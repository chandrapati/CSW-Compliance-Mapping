# Cisco Secure Workload — ISO 27001:2022 Compliance Framework
## Technical Runbook | Enterprise Accounts

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Annex A Controls)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Organizations pursuing or maintaining ISO/IEC
27001 certification (or transitioning their existing 27001:2013
certification to the 2022 revision), ISMS owners, and internal auditors.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *For each Annex A.8 (Technological) control, what specific artifact
  lands on the certification auditor's desk?*
- *Can my Statement of Applicability reference live, query-able
  evidence rather than annual screenshots and policy documents?*
- *For the new 2022 controls (A.8.9 configuration management, A.8.16
  monitoring activities, A.8.23 web filtering, A.8.28 secure coding),
  how does workload-resident telemetry contribute?*
- *During a stage-2 certification audit, what part of CSW can I
  demonstrate live to the auditor — and what's the script for that
  demo?*
- *For the A.5 Organizational controls around risk and incident
  management, what does workload telemetry add that policy alone
  doesn't?*

**What you'll need.** Defined ISMS scope, a current or draft Statement
of Applicability (SoA), your risk treatment plan, and your
certification body's stage-2 evidence template if available.

**Where to start.** Section 2 maps Annex A controls to CSW
capabilities; section 3 covers ISMS deployment patterns; sections 4–5
if you're approaching stage-2 audit or recertification.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](../docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](../docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- A.8.20–A.8.22 network segregation with workload-resident enforcement
- A.8.16 monitoring evidence from flow + denied-connection logs
- Supplier egress reconciliation via observed outbound flows

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

## 1. Overview

ISO 27001:2022 restructured Annex A from 114 controls across 14 domains to **93 controls across 4 themes**: Organizational, People, Physical, and Technological. CSW addresses the Technological theme controls most directly, with strong contributions to Organizational controls around risk and incident management.

### New in ISO 27001:2022 Relevant to CSW

| New Control | Ref | CSW Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Threat Intelligence | A.5.7 | Vulnerability CVE data feeds threat intel posture |
| Information Security for Cloud Services | A.5.23 | CSW cloud connectors support cloud inventory and policy context; enforcement depends on sensor / connector coverage and complements cloud-native IAM and network controls |
| ICT Readiness for Business Continuity | A.5.30 | Policy workspaces exportable for DR; sensor redundancy |
| Web Filtering | A.8.23 | CSW blocks unauthorized outbound from sensitive workloads |
| Secure Coding | A.8.28 | Process monitoring detects unexpected code execution |
| Data Masking | A.8.11 | Enforce encrypted paths; detect plaintext sensitive data flows |

## 2. Annex A Technological Controls — CSW Mapping

### A.8 — Technological Controls (Primary CSW Domain)

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| A.8.15 | Logging | Full network + process telemetry; configurable retention |
| A.8.16 | Monitoring Activities | Real-time anomaly detection; policy violation alerting |
| A.8.19 | Installation of Software | Process hash monitoring detects unauthorized software |
| A.8.20 | Networks Security | Micro-segmentation enforces network security at workload level |
| A.8.21 | Security of Network Services | ADM maps observed network services; policy enforces approved services where CSW enforcement is deployed |
| A.8.22 | Segregation of Networks | Scope-based isolation (PHI, CDE, production, dev) |
| A.8.23 | Web Filtering | Block unauthorized outbound web access from sensitive scopes |
| A.8.25 | Secure Development Lifecycle | ADM detects new communication paths introduced by code changes |
| A.8.29 | Security Testing in Dev & Acceptance | ADM baseline comparison pre/post deployment |

### A.5 — Organizational Controls (CSW Contribution)

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| A.5.7 | Threat Intelligence | CVE vulnerability data provides threat-informed risk posture |
| A.5.23 | Cloud Services Security | Cloud connectors support unified visibility and policy context across AWS/Azure/GCP, with enforcement dependent on deployment coverage |
| A.5.25 | Information Security Incident Management | Forensic telemetry supports incident response and root cause analysis |
| A.5.30 | ICT Readiness | Policy workspace backup; simulation mode for DR testing |
| A.5.37 | Documented Operating Procedures | ADM-generated dependency maps serve as documented network procedures |

## 3. CSW Deployment for ISO 27001:2022

### 3.1 ISMS Scope Definition

Map ISO 27001 ISMS scope to CSW scopes:

```
Root Scope
└── ISMS-Boundary
    ├── Information-Assets (A.8.22 segregation)
    │   ├── Confidential-Data-Stores
    │   ├── Business-Critical-Apps
    │   └── Customer-Data-Systems
    ├── Supporting-Systems
    │   ├── Identity-Management
    │   └── Security-Monitoring
    └── External-Parties (A.5.19 — supplier security)
        └── Third-Party-Integrations
```

### 3.2 Statement of Applicability (SoA) Evidence

CSW produces evidence for the following SoA controls:

**A.8.15 Logging** → CSW flow + process telemetry export
**A.8.16 Monitoring** → Alert history export, anomaly detection log
**A.8.20 Network Security** → Policy workspace export, ADM map
**A.8.22 Segregation** → Scope membership export, policy enforcement log
**A.5.7 Threat Intelligence** → Vulnerability report with CVE mapping
**A.5.25 Incident Management** → Forensic telemetry export per incident

### 3.3 Risk Treatment Plan Support

ISO 27001 requires a risk treatment plan. CSW data feeds directly into this:

| Risk Scenario | CSW Data Input | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorized lateral access | ADM reveals actual access paths | Micro-segmentation blocks unauthorized paths |
| Unpatched critical vulnerabilities | CVE scan with CVSS scores | Prioritized remediation + compensating controls |
| Insider threat / data exfiltration | Outbound flow anomaly detection | Alert + block unauthorized outbound |
| Third-party compromise | Partner scope isolation + audit | Restricted access paths + full logging |
| Cloud misconfiguration | Cloud connector inventory | Policy enforcement on cloud workloads |
