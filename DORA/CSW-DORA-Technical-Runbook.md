# Cisco Secure Workload — DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)
## Technical Runbook | EU Financial Entities & Critical ICT Third-Party Providers

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 — DORA | **Effective:** 17 January 2025 | **Environment:** Hybrid

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** EU financial entities in scope of DORA — credit
institutions, payment & e-money institutions, investment firms, CCPs,
trading venues, insurers, crypto-asset service providers, crowdfunding
service providers — and the critical ICT third-party providers (CTPPs)
that serve them. Also useful for the security architects, ICT risk
officers, and Cisco SAs preparing those organisations for their
competent-authority engagement.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Article 8 — ICT Risk Management Framework: can I produce a current
  inventory of all ICT assets supporting "important business functions"
  (IBFs), classified by criticality, and prove the inventory is
  refreshed continuously rather than annually?*
- *Article 9(2) — protection and prevention: for each IBF, can I
  demonstrate that network segmentation between supporting systems is
  enforced and continuously verified, not just designed?*
- *Article 10 — detection: when an anomalous workload-to-workload flow
  appears inside an IBF (e.g., a payments service starts talking to a
  general ledger system it never touched before), is it detected, and
  what is the artefact?*
- *Article 17 — ICT-related incident management: when a major incident
  occurs, can I reconstruct the exact process and flow context at the
  time of compromise to support the 4h/24h/72h/1-month reporting
  cadence under Article 19?*
- *Article 24–25 — digital operational resilience testing (TLPT, threat-
  led penetration testing): can red teams run TIBER-EU style exercises
  against my environment, and can I produce the workload-level evidence
  (lateral movement attempts, segmentation holds, detections) the
  testers and the lead competent authority will ask for?*
- *Article 28 — ICT third-party risk: do I actually know which third-
  party (CTPP) services my critical workloads call out to, on what
  ports, with what frequency — independent of what the contract says?*
- *If my lead competent authority requests under Article 50 the
  "results of testing" or "register of information" on third-party
  arrangements, what do I hand over from CSW within one business day?*

**What you'll need.** Your current ICT asset inventory, the list of
"important business functions" your management body has approved
(Article 8(4)), your current Register of Information for ICT third-
party arrangements (Article 28(3)), your incident classification
criteria under the RTS on classification of major incidents, and the
list of competent and lead authorities applicable to your entity.

**Where to start.** Section 2 if you're scoping an IBF; sections 3–4
if you're building the ICT risk management framework artefacts;
sections 5–6 if you're preparing for TLPT; section 7 if your incident
response programme is the gap; section 9 if third-party visibility is
the open item.

**Important.** DORA assigns ultimate accountability to the
*management body* (Article 5). Nothing in this runbook substitutes for
that governance. CSW gives the management body the *evidence* it needs
to discharge that accountability with confidence; it does not discharge
it on the body's behalf.

---

## 1. Overview

DORA harmonises the ICT risk management requirements for the EU
financial sector across five pillars:

1. **ICT Risk Management** (Articles 5–16) — governance, risk
   framework, asset inventory, protection, detection, response,
   learning.
2. **ICT-Related Incident Management, Classification & Reporting**
   (Articles 17–23) — single harmonised reporting flow to competent
   authorities.
3. **Digital Operational Resilience Testing** (Articles 24–27) —
   including TLPT every 3 years for significant entities.
4. **Managing of ICT Third-Party Risk** (Articles 28–44) — register of
   information, contractual provisions, oversight of CTPPs by the ESAs.
5. **Information-Sharing Arrangements** (Article 45) — voluntary
   intelligence exchange between financial entities.

**Where CSW fits.** CSW is not an end-to-end DORA solution and does
not address Pillars 4 (third-party contracts) or 5 (information
sharing) directly. It does, however, provide the workload-level
evidence engine that Pillars 1, 2 and 3 increasingly require — and
gives you measurable visibility into Pillar 4's *technical* exposure
question ("what is my workload actually talking to that I don't
control?").

| DORA Pillar | CSW contribution |
|---|---|
| Pillar 1 — ICT Risk Management | Continuous asset inventory (Art. 8), segmentation enforcement (Art. 9), behavioural detection (Art. 10), forensic flow data for response & learning (Arts. 11, 13). |
| Pillar 2 — Incident Management | Reconstructable process and flow timeline supporting initial, intermediate and final reports (Art. 19). |
| Pillar 3 — Resilience Testing | Workload-level evidence for vulnerability assessments and scenario-based tests (Art. 25(1)); attack-path data and segmentation telemetry for TLPT (Art. 26). |
| Pillar 4 — Third-Party Risk | Independent technical view of which third-party endpoints critical workloads call (complements but does not replace contractual register). |
| Pillar 5 — Information Sharing | Indicators-of-compromise and behavioural signatures derived from CSW telemetry can feed sectoral sharing arrangements. |

## 2. Scoping — Important Business Functions (IBFs)

Article 8(4) requires entities to identify and classify ICT systems
supporting "important business functions." Everything else in DORA
escalates in stringency for these.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Get the management-body-approved IBF list
  → Typical examples (insert your own):
      - Card payment authorisation
      - SEPA credit transfer initiation
      - Securities settlement
      - Custody booking
      - Trading order routing
      - KYC / AML decisioning

Step 2: Label every workload that supports an IBF
  CSW UI → Inventory → Bulk Label
  Mandatory labels:
    dora_ibf:        true | false
    ibf_name:        [IBF identifier from management body register]
    ibf_criticality: critical | important | supporting
    data_class:      personal | financial | confidential | internal
    entity_legal:    [legal entity in scope of DORA]

Step 3: Build an IBF Scope per business function
  CSW UI → Organize → Scopes → New
  Filter: ibf_name = "card-payment-auth" → Save scope
  Repeat for each IBF
  → This becomes the unit of policy, evidence, and reporting

Step 4: Validate completeness against the inventory baseline
  → Cross-check CSW inventory count vs. your CMDB / ServiceNow IBF view
  → Any delta = scoping risk; resolve before formal Art. 8 sign-off
```

**Evidence:** Per-IBF scope export (CSV) with workload count, OS,
location, owner, last-seen timestamp.

## 3. Article 8 — ICT Asset Inventory

DORA Article 8(1) requires a current inventory of *all* ICT assets,
including their interdependencies. Article 8(6) specifies it must be
updated "periodically and on every significant change."

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Achieve sensor coverage on every workload supporting an IBF
  → Linux:   yum/dnf/apt + systemctl enable tetd
  → Windows: MSI install + service verification
  → Containers: DaemonSet sensor for K8s; per-node sensor for ECS/AKS/GKE
  → Cloud:   External Orchestrators (AWS/Azure/GCP) for asset metadata

Step 2: Configure interdependency capture (ADM)
  CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation → ADM Run
  Scope: each IBF Scope (run per-IBF, not all at once)
  Duration: ≥ 14 days to capture month-end batch processes

Step 3: Schedule continuous inventory drift detection
  CSW UI → Reports → Inventory → Schedule
  Cadence: daily snapshot, weekly delta report
  Owner: ICT Risk function (delegated under Art. 6(4))

Step 4: Wire the inventory feed to your Register of Information
  → API: /openapi/v1/inventory
  → Use: nightly export → reconcile against management's Register
```

**Evidence:** (a) current inventory export with every workload's OS,
hostname, IP, agent version, owner labels, last-check-in; (b) ADM
dependency graph per IBF; (c) drift report showing additions/removals
since the previous management-body review.

---

## 4. Article 9 — Protection and Prevention

Article 9(2) calls for "design, procurement and operation" of ICT
systems that minimise impact, including segregation, monitoring and
resilient configuration.

**CSW Implementation — IBF Segmentation Pattern:**
```
Step 1: Define the IBF policy workspace
  CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation → New Workspace
  Name: dora-ibf-{ibf_name}
  Scope: ibf_name = {ibf_name}

Step 2: Use ADM to compute the as-observed policy
  → Run ADM on the workspace; review proposed clusters
  → Reject "noise" clusters; rename clusters to business roles
  → Clusters become policy intents

Step 3: Layer DORA-aligned hardening rules on top
  DENY:  Any IBF workload → Internet (egress) unless explicitly required
  DENY:  Non-IBF workloads → IBF workloads (cross-IBF lateral)
  DENY:  Plaintext protocols (HTTP/21/23/389) → IBF workloads
  ALLOW: IBF workloads → approved CTPP egress endpoints (whitelist by
         FQDN/IP, with port + frequency constraint where supported)

Step 4: Run in Simulation for ≥ 30 days
  → Capture and resolve every legitimate-but-blocked flow with the
    application owner; document every exception in the workspace notes
  → This is the artefact that demonstrates "continuous review" required
    under Art. 9(4)(g)

Step 5: Promote to Enforce; gate with change-management approval
  → Each subsequent change is captured in CSW change history
  → Evidence: enforcement diff report, exported per quarter
```

**Evidence:** (a) policy workspace export per IBF; (b) simulation→
enforcement transition log; (c) quarterly enforcement diff report.

---

## 5. Article 10 — Detection

Article 10 requires detection of "anomalous activities, including
ICT network performance issues and ICT-related incidents."

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enable behavioural detections
  CSW UI → Defend → Forensics → Rules
  → Out-of-the-box rules: privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement
  → Custom rules: encode IBF-specific abuse patterns
      Example: "Process on payment-auth host writes to /etc/shadow"
      Example: "Outbound TLS to non-allowlisted FQDN from settlement host"

Step 2: Enable Conversation-graph anomaly detection
  → Auto-flag new edges in the IBF dependency graph
  → Auto-flag changes in port/protocol distribution per workload

Step 3: Wire alerts to your SOC
  CSW UI → Manage → Data Tap → SIEM
  → Splunk HEC, QRadar, Sentinel, Cisco XDR
  → Tag alerts with dora_ibf=true so SOC can prioritise per Art. 17

Step 4: Track detection latency (an Art. 11(2) lessons-learned input)
  → CSW timestamps every detection; SIEM timestamps acknowledgement
  → Compute MTTD per IBF; report to management body quarterly
```

**Evidence:** (a) detection rule catalogue with last-modified dates;
(b) SIEM forwarding configuration; (c) MTTD trend report per IBF.

---

## 6. Article 11 — Response and Recovery

Article 11(2) requires "comprehensive ICT business continuity policy"
including procedures for "containment, eradication and recovery."

**CSW Implementation — Containment Playbook:**
```
Scenario: SOC declares a confirmed compromise on workload W in IBF X

Step 1 (T+0): Quarantine W
  CSW UI → Inventory → W → Apply Quarantine Policy
  → Pre-built policy: deny all, allow only IR jump-host on TCP/22
  → Typically applied in seconds without firewall change tickets

Step 2 (T+0): Pivot to other workloads in IBF X with similar exposure
  → Use CSW vulnerability + process inventory to identify peers running
    the same software/version → preemptively quarantine if criticality
    warrants

Step 3 (T+5min): Capture forensic baseline
  → CSW historical flow data: all conversations to/from W in last 30 days
  → CSW process snapshot: every process running on W at containment
  → CSW package inventory: every installed package and version
  → Export to incident case; this is the Art. 11(2)(d) "post-incident
    review" raw material
```

**Evidence:** (a) quarantine policy applied (timestamped); (b) forensic
export bundle; (c) containment-to-remediation timeline.

---

## 7. Articles 17–23 — Incident Management, Classification & Reporting

DORA harmonises incident reporting into one flow with three deadlines
under Article 19 (subject to the implementing RTS on incident
reporting):

| Phase | Deadline (typical, confirm against final RTS) | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| Initial notification | As soon as possible, no later than **4 h after classification as major** | Nature, type, root cause if known, geographic spread |
| Intermediate report | Within **72 h** of initial | Updated facts, status of containment, impact estimates |
| Final report | Within **1 month** of initial | Root cause analysis, remediation, lessons learned |

**CSW Implementation — Reporting Evidence:**
```
For each major incident, assemble from CSW:

  (a) Affected workload set
      → Inventory query: hostnames, IPs, OS, IBF labels, ownership
  (b) Time-anchored flow record
      → CSW historical conversations: source, destination, port, byte
        counts, timestamps, geographic origin via flow context
  (c) Process activity record
      → Every process spawned on affected workloads in the window
  (d) Software footprint at time of incident
      → Package list, CVE exposure at that moment (not "today")
  (e) Containment evidence
      → Policy applied; flow drop count after policy; time-to-quarantine
  (f) Post-incident control proof
      → Diff between pre-incident segmentation and remediated state

These six artefacts populate the standard incident report template
your competent authority will accept.
```

**Evidence:** (a) incident dossier per major event; (b) MTTD/MTTR
metrics by IBF; (c) annual aggregate incident-trend report (an
Art. 13 "learning" input to the management body).

---

## 8. Articles 24–27 — Digital Operational Resilience Testing

Article 24 requires a sound and comprehensive testing programme.
Article 25(1) lists baseline tests (vulnerability assessments,
scenario-based, performance, end-to-end). Article 26 introduces TLPT
(threat-led penetration testing) every 3 years for significant
entities, modelled on TIBER-EU.

**CSW Implementation — Baseline Test Support (Art. 25):**
```
Vulnerability assessment:
  → CSW Vulnerability Dashboard: per-workload CVE list with CVSS,
    exploit availability, EPSS score
  → Filter by ibf_ciricality=critical → priority remediation queue
  → Evidence: weekly export tied to remediation ticket IDs

Scenario-based testing:
  → CSW supports "what-if" policy queries:
      "If host X were compromised, which IBF Y workloads are reachable
       under current policy?"
  → Use to validate segmentation assumptions before tabletop exercises
  → Evidence: pre-test reachability report; post-test reachability report
```

**CSW Implementation — TLPT Support (Art. 26):**
```
Pre-engagement (with TIBER-EU lead):
  → Scope selection: provide IBF inventory + dependency graph to red team
  → Threat intel grounding: provide CSW outbound-flow patterns to scope
    realistic attacker pivots

During engagement:
  → Red team operates blind; no CSW data shared in real time
  → Defenders may be in "purple" mode if pre-agreed; CSW alerts can
    be observed but not acted on without authorised abort

Post-engagement:
  → CSW timeline reconstruction: every flow attempted by red team,
    every detection generated, every block enforced
  → Gap analysis: which Art. 9 segmentation rules held, which were
    bypassed, which detections fired vs. missed
  → Evidence: full red-team activity reconstruction, comparable to the
    findings report — this is the artefact the lead authority and
    your management body will rely on most
```

**Evidence:** (a) Art. 25 test catalogue with results and remediation
status; (b) per-TLPT engagement reconstruction package.

## 9. Articles 28–30 — ICT Third-Party Risk (Technical Lens)

DORA Pillar 4 is largely contractual and governance-driven (Articles
28(3)–(7), 30 contractual provisions, 31–44 CTPP oversight). CSW does
*not* substitute for the Register of Information or for legal review.
It does answer the technical companion question: *what are my critical
workloads actually doing with third parties?*

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enumerate third-party egress per IBF
  CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  Filter: source_scope = ibf_name=X AND destination_ip ∉ internal_ranges
  → Group by destination FQDN/IP; rank by byte count, frequency
  → Output: technical view of third-party dependency per IBF

Step 2: Reconcile against the Register of Information
  → For each observed third-party endpoint, find the corresponding entry
    in the Register; flag missing / undocumented endpoints
  → This is the *gap* between contracted and actual third-party usage

Step 3: Enforce egress allow-listing for IBF workloads
  ALLOW: IBF workloads → {Register-listed third-party endpoints only}
  DENY:  IBF workloads → all other external destinations
  → Run in Simulation; resolve gaps; promote to Enforce
  → New third-party usage now requires Register update before deployment

Step 4: Continuous monitoring
  → CSW alert: "new external destination from IBF workload"
  → Routes to ICT Risk function for Register reconciliation within
    the cadence required under Art. 28(3)
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-IBF third-party flow report; (b) Register-vs-
observed delta report; (c) egress policy enforcement diff history.

> **Important caveat.** A CTPP's *internal* posture is out of scope
> for CSW unless that CTPP also runs CSW within its environment.
> Article 30 contractual provisions remain the primary control for
> CTPP behaviour outside your perimeter.

---

## 10. Article 13 — Learning and Evolving

Article 13 requires a continuous-improvement loop. The combination of
incident metrics (§7), test outcomes (§8) and third-party drift
findings (§9) produces a quarterly evidence pack the management body
can use to discharge its Article 5 accountability.

**Recommended quarterly pack contents:**

1. IBF inventory drift summary
2. Segmentation policy diff (changes, new exceptions, removed exceptions)
3. Incident summary with MTTD/MTTR per IBF
4. Vulnerability backlog aged by criticality
5. Third-party egress drift summary
6. Test programme status (Art. 25 baseline + Art. 26 TLPT cycle position)
7. Open audit/competent-authority findings and remediation status

---

| Authority asks | You provide |
|---|---|
| "Show your IBF asset inventory as of [date]" | CSW inventory snapshot filtered by `dora_ibf=true`, dated |
| "Demonstrate segmentation between IBF A and IBF B" | Workspace export + Simulation run showing zero allowed flows between scopes |
| "Provide the incident timeline for event [ID]" | Six-artefact dossier (§7) |
| "Show how you monitor third-party drift" | Register-vs-observed delta report (§9) |
| "Provide the TLPT remediation evidence" | Pre/post reachability reports + workspace diff + detection rule additions |

## 13. Related Frameworks

DORA shares substantial control surface with:

- **NIS2** — many of the Article 21(2) measures overlap with DORA
  Pillars 1–2 (see [NIS2 runbook](../NIS2/CSW-NIS2-Technical-Runbook.md)).
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — Annex A controls map cleanly to DORA
  Pillar 1 (see [ISO 27001 runbook](../ISO-27001-2022/iso27001-runbook.md)).
- **NIST SP 800-207** — DORA's segmentation and continuous-monitoring
  expectations align with the seven ZTA tenets (see
  [800-207 runbook](../NIST-800-207/CSW-NIST-800-207-Technical-Runbook.md)).
- **PCI DSS v4.0** — for payment-services entities, DORA Pillar 1 and
  PCI Reqs 1, 7, 10, 11 share evidence (see
  [PCI runbook](../PCI-DSS-v4/pci-runbook.md)).

This runbook describes how Cisco Secure Workload capabilities can
support a DORA programme. It is **not** legal advice and does not
constitute a finding of compliance. Final classification of incidents,
identification of "important business functions," determination of
TLPT applicability, and contractual obligations under Articles 28–30
are the responsibility of the financial entity's management body and
its qualified legal and compliance counsel, working with the relevant
competent authority. Always validate against the latest published RTS
and ITS and against any guidance issued by your lead overseer.
