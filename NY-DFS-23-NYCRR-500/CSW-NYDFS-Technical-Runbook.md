## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Covered entities under 23 NYCRR Part 500 (banks, mortgage bankers/brokers, insurance companies, licensed lenders, money transmitters, virtual currency businesses, etc.); the CISO designated under §500.4; risk, audit, and compliance leaders preparing for the annual notice of compliance (§500.17(b)) and the senior officer / board-of-directors certification or acknowledgement.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Can I show the cybersecurity program (§500.2) operating across covered workloads and NPI-bearing applications, with evidence beyond a point-in-time sample?*
- *Can I show access privileges (§500.7) are restricted to least privilege at the workload-to-workload layer, not just at the identity layer?*
- *Can I produce a workload-level audit trail (§500.6) sufficient to detect and respond to a Cybersecurity Event?*
- *Can I evidence asset management (§500.13) for in-scope information systems?*
- *If a Cybersecurity Event occurs, can I rebuild the affected-systems timeline needed for §500.17(a) 72-hour notification scoping?*

**What you'll need.** Current information system inventory, NPI-bearing application list, third-party service provider register (§500.11), vulnerability management process (§500.5), incident response plan (§500.16), monitoring approach (§500.14), and the CISO function's reporting cadence.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping; 5–7 if you are designing and simulating policy; 9–10 if you are preparing for the annual §500.17(b) notice of compliance or the senior officer certification within the next quarter.

## 1. Overview

23 NYCRR Part 500 is a prescriptive cybersecurity rule. It defines a Cybersecurity Program (§500.2), Cybersecurity Policy (§500.3), CISO role (§500.4), and a set of technical and operational requirements covering vulnerability management, audit trail, access privileges, application security, risk assessment, third-party service providers, MFA, asset management, monitoring, encryption, incident response, and notification obligations.

CSW can support **technical evidence** for the workload-level dimensions of §500.2 (program), §500.5 (vulnerability management), §500.6 (audit trail), §500.7 (access privileges), §500.13 (asset management), §500.14 (monitoring), and §500.16 (incident response). CSW does **not** replace the CISO function, written policies, MFA / IAM enforcement, encryption programmes, the risk assessment itself, the 72-hour notification decision (§500.17(a)), or the senior officer certification.

### Part 500 Section Map and CSW Relevance

| Section | Topic | CSW relevance |
|---|---|---|
| §500.2 | Cybersecurity Program | Workload telemetry feeding the program; CSW outputs are program inputs, not the program itself |
| §500.3 | Cybersecurity Policy | Out of scope (governance) |
| §500.4 | CISO | Out of scope (role) |
| §500.5 | Vulnerability Management | CVE / package exposure with reachability context |
| §500.6 | Audit Trail | Workload-level flow + process telemetry retained over the required window |
| §500.7 | Access Privileges and Management | Workload-to-workload allowlist + audit; complements identity-layer privilege management |
| §500.8 | Application Security | Out of scope for code-level controls; CSW can show application reachability and dependencies |
| §500.9 | Risk Assessment | Workload reachability + vulnerability context as input to the assessment |
| §500.11 | Third-Party Service Provider Security Policy | Outbound flow visibility to third-party endpoints |
| §500.12 | MFA | Out of scope (identity control) |
| §500.13 | Asset Management and Data Retention | Workload inventory; scope + label evidence |
| §500.14 | Monitoring and Training | Continuous workload monitoring; alerts and anomaly indicators |
| §500.15 | Encryption | Detection of plaintext flows on regulated paths |
| §500.16 | Incident Response and BCDR Plans | Forensic flow / process telemetry; impact scoping |
| §500.17 | Notices to Superintendent | Affected-systems scoping inputs (decision is governance) |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] CSW cluster provisioned
- [ ] Sensor compatibility verified for Linux / Windows covered workloads
- [ ] Cloud accounts connected via CSW cloud connectors where covered workloads run in cloud
- [ ] Covered entity scope statement reviewed (which information systems are in scope of §500)
- [ ] NPI inventory reviewed with information owners
- [ ] Third-party service provider register available (§500.11)
- [ ] Stakeholders identified: CISO, application owners, internal audit
- [ ] Evidence retention period agreed and consistent with §500.6 expectations

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor & Connector Deployment (Days 1–5)

- Install software sensors on representative covered workloads in monitoring mode
- Connect cloud accounts as read-only CSW cloud connectors for in-scope cloud workloads
- Apply Day-1 labels: `application`, `env`, `data_class`, `npi`, `criticality`, `owner`, `compliance=nydfs-500`
- Maintain a `cannot-instrument` register for managed SaaS and appliances; the register is evidence
- Retain a Phase-1 sensor inventory baseline (status, version, last check-in)

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Asset Management (Days 6–10) — supports §500.13

### 4.1 Suggested Scope Architecture

```
Root Scope
└── NYDFS-500
    ├── Covered-Systems
    │   ├── Customer-Channels
    │   ├── Account-and-Ledger
    │   ├── Payments-and-Settlement
    │   └── Underwriting-Claims
    ├── NPI-Applications
    │   ├── Customer-Data-Stores
    │   └── Analytics-on-NPI
    ├── Critical-Operations
    │   ├── Identity-Adjacent
    │   ├── Monitoring
    │   └── Patch-Management
    └── Third-Party-Service-Providers
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters

```
Filter: NPI-Application-Candidates
  - Tag: data_class = npi
  - Listening port: 1521, 3306, 5432, 1433, 27017
  - Hostname / application pattern matches NPI app names

Filter: Third-Party-Service-Provider-Edges
  - Destination outside on-prem and cloud allow-lists
  - Tag: managed_by = vendor
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters for Part 500 |
|---|---|---|
| `npi` | true, false | Anchor for §500.7 / §500.13 / §500.15 |
| `data_class` | npi, customer, internal, public | Required to evidence handling and protection of NPI |
| `criticality` | critical, important, standard | Risk-tiering for §500.9 and §500.13 |
| `application` | <named app> | Connects workloads to applications named in the program |
| `owner` | <named function> | Accountability |
| `compliance` | nydfs-500 | Filters CSW evidence to Part 500 scope |

Workload inventory + labels + scope membership = §500.13 asset management evidence.

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

Run ADM for each scope across a 2-week-minimum window that covers business cycles. Document:

| Question | Part 500 section |
|---|---|
| Which workloads receive connections from outside Covered-Systems? | §500.7 (access privileges) |
| Which database connections are plaintext? | §500.15 (encryption) |
| Which workloads reach Third-Party-Service-Providers? | §500.11 |
| Are there unexpected lateral flows within NPI-Applications? | §500.7 / §500.14 |
| Which workloads are reached by admin paths? | §500.7 (privileged paths) |

Use ADM clusters to confirm or correct `npi`, `data_class`, and `criticality` labels with application owners.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35) — supports §500.7

### 6.1 Part-500-Aligned Policy Framework

**Absolute policies:**

```
DENY  Any                       → NPI-Applications              (default deny inbound)
DENY  NPI-Applications          → Internet                      (no direct internet egress from NPI)
DENY  Corporate-IT              → NPI-Applications              (admin only via approved jump paths)
```

**Allowlist policies (least privilege):**

```
ALLOW Customer-Channels          → Account-and-Ledger           tcp/443
ALLOW Account-and-Ledger         → Customer-Data-Stores         tcp/<db-port-tls>
ALLOW NPI-Applications           → Identity-Adjacent            tcp/636, tcp/88
ALLOW Jump-Hosts                 → Covered-Systems              tcp/22, tcp/3389
ALLOW Covered-Systems            → Monitoring                   tcp/443
```

**Catch-all:**

```
LOG   Any                        → NPI-Applications              (unmatched inbound)
LOG   NPI-Applications           → Any                           (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Lifecycle

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2 weeks | Validate the candidate policy |
| 2 | Enforcement (high-confidence rules only) | 1 week | Enforce obvious deny rules |
| 3 | Full Enforcement | Ongoing | Workload allowlist enforced; monthly exception review |

Workspace snapshots = §500.7 evidence.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Section Mapping with CSW Evidence

| Part 500 section | What CSW produces | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| §500.2 | Continuous workload telemetry; periodic evidence pack | Demonstrate program is operating, not just defined |
| §500.5 | Vulnerability + reachability report scoped to NYDFS-500 | Risk-based remediation prioritisation evidence |
| §500.6 | Flow + process telemetry retained per retention policy | Audit trail (workload network layer) |
| §500.7 | Policy workspace + enforcement / violation log | Least-privilege evidence at workload-to-workload layer |
| §500.9 | Reachability and exposure inputs | Inputs to the periodic risk assessment |
| §500.11 | Outbound flow summary to third-party endpoints | Reconcile against the third-party register |
| §500.13 | Workload inventory; scope + label export | Asset management and classification evidence |
| §500.14 | Continuous monitoring; alerts; anomaly indicators | Monitoring evidence (network + process layer) |
| §500.15 | Plaintext-flow detection on regulated paths | Detection input only; encryption is enforced by other controls |
| §500.16 | Forensic flow + process search across the incident window | Incident scoping and timeline |
| §500.17(a) | Affected-systems list, time windows, paths | Scoping input to the 72-hour notification decision |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability & Risk Management (§500.5 / §500.9)

Use reachability-weighted CVE data:

```
Priority 1: Critical CVE on NPI-Applications with inbound reachability
Priority 2: Critical CVE on Covered-Systems
Priority 3: Critical CVE on supporting workloads with reach into NPI-Applications
```

Document compensating controls in the policy workspace exception register; this register is itself evidence under §500.7 / §500.9.

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting (§500.14)

| Alert | Trigger | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorised reach to NPI-Applications | Any unapproved source → NPI scope | §500.7 |
| Plaintext on NPI path | HTTP / unencrypted DB protocol from NPI scope | §500.15 |
| Lateral movement inside Covered-Systems | New east-west flow outside baseline | §500.14 / §500.16 |
| External egress from NPI | NPI-Applications → external endpoint not in allow-list | §500.11 |
| Policy violation | Enforced policy block triggered | §500.7 |
| Sensor offline | Agent stops reporting | §500.6 / §500.14 (evidence integrity) |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry (§500.16)

For each material incident, retain:

- Flow log scoped to affected workload(s) and time window (with process context)
- Process search output
- Policy workspace state at the time of the incident
- Vulnerability snapshot for the affected workload(s)
- Third-party endpoint reach summary if relevant

---

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Audit / §500.17(b) Cycle (quarterly recommended; annually required)

| Evidence item | CSW source area | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Workload inventory | Inventory export | §500.13 |
| Scope + label membership | Scope membership export | §500.13 |
| Approved vs. observed flows | ADM workspace export | §500.7 / §500.14 |
| Policy workspace snapshot | Policy workspace export | §500.7 |
| Policy enforcement / violations | Policy analysis output | §500.7 / §500.16 |
| Vulnerability + reachability | Vulnerability report scoped to NYDFS-500 | §500.5 / §500.9 |
| Third-party egress summary | Flow search to vendor endpoints | §500.11 |
| Incident timeline sample | Flow + process search | §500.16 / §500.17(a) |
| Exception register | Policy workspace exceptions list | §500.7 (risk acceptance) |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- **Monthly:** scope / inventory hygiene; third-party egress reconciliation
- **Quarterly:** policy workspace review; refresh evidence pack 10.1
- **Annually:** §500.17(b) notice of compliance; senior officer / board acknowledgement; refresh CSW baselines
- **Continuously:** policy drift detection; ADM re-run every 90 days

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Treating CSW evidence as full §500 compliance | CSW is one technical input; §500.2 program is broader |
| `npi` labels missing or inconsistent | Reconcile NPI inventory ↔ CSW labels monthly |
| Scope set by subnet rather than workload | Use process + label identity |
| ADM run too short, missing cycle peaks | Minimum 2-week ADM; align to business cycles |
| Third-party egress not in `vendor` scope | Maintain the vendor register; ensure CSW labels mirror it |
| §500.17(a) treated as automated | Notification is a CISO/senior-officer decision; CSW provides scoping inputs |
| Encryption assumed by port number | Confirm by process + observed handshake, not by TCP port |
