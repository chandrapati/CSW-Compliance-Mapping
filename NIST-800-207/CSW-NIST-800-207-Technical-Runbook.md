# Cisco Secure Workload — NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture
## Technical Runbook | Federal Agencies & Enterprise Accounts

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture — Seven Tenets) | **Environment:** Hybrid

---

## 1. Overview

NIST SP 800-207 defines Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) through seven foundational tenets. Unlike maturity models (e.g., CISA ZTMM), 800-207 focuses on architectural requirements and logical components — the Policy Engine (PE), Policy Administrator (PA), and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).

**CSW's role in 800-207 architecture:**
- **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP):** CSW micro-segmentation enforces workload-level access decisions
- **Policy Information Point:** CSW telemetry (vulnerability, process, flow) feeds the policy engine
- **Continuous Diagnostics:** CSW provides the asset posture monitoring required by 800-207's CDM integration

## 2. Tenet-by-Tenet Implementation Guide

### Tenet 1 — All Data Sources and Computing Services Are Resources

**Goal:** Every asset — on-prem, cloud, IoT, SaaS — is treated as a managed resource, regardless of ownership or location.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Deploy software sensors on all on-prem workloads
  → Linux: rpm/dpkg install + systemctl enable tetd
  → Windows: MSI install + service verification

Step 2: Connect cloud accounts (agentless discovery)
  CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → AWS: IAM Role with EC2/VPC read permissions
  → Azure: Service Principal with Reader role
  → GCP: Service Account with Compute Viewer role

Step 3: Label every workload as a classified resource
  Mandatory labels:
    env:          production | staging | dev
    data:         phi | pii | pci | sensitive | public
    compliance:   nist-800-207 | hipaa | pci | none
    app:          [application name]
    owner:        [team name]

Step 4: Validate inventory completeness
  CSW UI → Inventory
  → Filter: label missing → Identify unlabeled workloads
  → Target: 100% label coverage before ADM run
```

**Evidence:** Inventory export (CSV), cloud connector discovery report

### Tenet 2 — All Communication Is Secured Regardless of Network Location

**Goal:** No implicit trust based on network position. All traffic — internal and external — must be authenticated and encrypted.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Identify unencrypted communications via ADM
  CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  Filter: Protocol = HTTP (80), FTP (21), Telnet (23), LDAP (389)
  Scope: All monitored workloads
  → Export: Unencrypted flow report (baseline)

Step 2: Create blocking policies for non-compliant protocols
  CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation → New Workspace
  Name: ZTA-Encryption-Enforcement
  
  DENY policies:
    DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 80)    # HTTP
    DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 21)    # FTP
    DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 23)    # Telnet
    DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 389)   # Plain LDAP
    DENY: Sensitive-Scope → Any (port 80)    # HTTP egress

Step 3: Run in Simulation mode first
  → Validate no legitimate apps broken by encryption enforcement
  → Work with app owners to remediate unencrypted dependencies
  → Enforce after 2-week simulation validation

Step 4: Quarterly re-scan
  → Re-run Flow Search for unencrypted protocols
  → Any new violations: immediate alert + policy update
```

**Evidence:** Unencrypted flow report (before/after), policy enforcement log, quarterly protocol compliance report

---

### Tenet 3 — Access to Individual Resources Is Granted Per-Session

**Goal:** Access must be scoped to specific individual resources, evaluated per connection. No broad network segment access.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: ADM-based individual resource policy
  CSW UI → Investigate → ADM
  → Run for minimum 4 weeks on all scopes
  → Export ADM clusters = individual resource access map

Step 2: Build workload-level allowlist (not subnet-level)
  For each workload in sensitive scope:
    ALLOW: [Source Workload A] → [Dest Workload B] (port X)
    ALLOW: [Source Workload C] → [Dest Workload B] (port Y)
    DENY:  All other → [Dest Workload B]

  Key principle: policies reference workload identity
  (hostname/label), NOT IP ranges or subnets

Step 3: Default-deny for all sensitive scopes
  → Every sensitive workload starts with DENY ALL inbound
  → Only explicitly documented flows are permitted
  → No "allow same subnet" rules — violates Tenet 3

Step 4: Per-session audit trail
  CSW logs every connection: source, destination, process,
  user, timestamp, bytes, and policy decision (allow/deny)
  → Satisfies NIST 800-207 per-session access record requirement
```

**Evidence:** Per-session flow log export, policy workspace (allowlist rules), policy denial log

---

### Tenet 4 — Access Is Determined by Dynamic Policy

**Goal:** Policy must incorporate observable state — device posture, user behavior, environmental conditions. Static rules are insufficient.

**CSW Implementation:**

**4a. Label-Driven Dynamic Scoping**
```
When a workload label changes → scope membership updates → policy applies automatically

Example:
  Workload X gains label: data=phi
  → Workload X auto-joins PHI-Zone scope
  → PHI-Zone policies (default-deny, encrypted-only) apply immediately
  → No manual policy rule change required
```

**4b. Vulnerability-Informed Compensating Controls**
```
CSW vulnerability alert → SOAR → CSW API policy update

Workflow:
  Trigger: New Critical CVE (CVSS 9.0+) detected on Workload Y
  SOAR Action:
    POST /openapi/v1/policies
    Body: {
      "name": "vuln-compensating-Workload-Y",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "ALLOW",
      "src": "Admin-Jump-Host",
      "dst": "Workload-Y",
      "port": "22"
    }
    + DENY all other inbound to Workload-Y
  Duration: Until patch applied + vulnerability cleared
```

**4c. SOAR-Mediated Dynamic Isolation**
```
CSW anomaly alert → SOAR → CSW API → Workload isolation

Example SOAR playbook (Splunk SOAR / Palo Alto XSOAR):
  Trigger: CSW high-severity anomaly on Workload Z
  Step 1: Query CSW API for workload identity
  Step 2: Create isolation policy via CSW API
  Step 3: Notify SOC analyst with context
  Step 4: Await analyst approval to restore normal policy
```

**Evidence:** API audit log, SOAR-to-CSW integration log, label-change-to-policy-update trace

---

### Tenet 5 — Enterprise Monitors and Measures Integrity and Security Posture of All Assets

**Goal:** Continuous, automated asset health monitoring. No assumed-healthy assets. Posture data feeds access decisions.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Vulnerability Monitoring:
  CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability
  → Continuous scan (no scheduling required)
  → Alert thresholds:
      CVSS 9.0+: Alert SIEM immediately
      CVSS 7.0–8.9: Alert within 4 hours
      CVSS 4.0–6.9: Daily digest
  → Export: Weekly vulnerability report per scope

Process Integrity Monitoring:
  CSW UI → Alerts → Process Anomaly
  → Enable: New process not in ADM baseline
  → Enable: Process hash change (modified binary)
  → Enable: Unexpected listening port (new service)
  → Alert: SIEM + email + Webex

Configuration Drift Detection:
  CSW compares current state to ADM baseline continuously
  → New flow not in baseline: Alert
  → New process not in baseline: Alert
  → New port not in baseline: Alert
  → Quarterly ADM re-run: Validate and update baseline
```

**Evidence:** Vulnerability trend report (weekly), process anomaly alert log, configuration drift report

---

### Tenet 6 — Authentication and Authorization Are Dynamic and Strictly Enforced

**Goal:** Every access request must be authenticated and authorized. No cached, assumed, or implicit authorizations.

**CSW Role (Network Enforcement Layer):**
```
CSW enforces the network path to authentication systems:

DENY policies for unauthenticated paths:
  DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 389)   # Block plain LDAP
  DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 5985)  # Block WinRM HTTP
  DENY: Any → DB-Servers (unauthenticated ports)

ALLOW policies for authenticated paths only:
  ALLOW: App-Servers → LDAP-Server (port 636)    # LDAPS only
  ALLOW: Workstations → KDC (port 88)            # Kerberos
  ALLOW: Jump-Host → Sensitive-Scope (port 22)   # SSH only
```

**Complementary Controls Required for Full Tenet 6:**
| Capability | CSW | Complementary Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Network path to auth systems | ✅ CSW enforces | — |
| Identity Provider (IdP) authentication | ❌ Not CSW | Okta, Azure AD, Cisco ISE |
| MFA enforcement | ❌ Not CSW | Duo Security, Azure MFA |
| Continuous session re-evaluation | ❌ Not CSW | Cisco Secure Access (ZTNA) |
| Device certificate validation | ❌ Not CSW | Cisco ISE, Intune |

**Evidence:** LDAPS enforcement log, unauthenticated access alert log, auth path policy workspace

---

### Tenet 7 — Enterprise Collects Information and Uses It to Improve Security Posture

**Goal:** Telemetry collection is not just for alerting — it must feed a continuous improvement loop that evolves the security posture over time.

**CSW Implementation:**

**7a. SIEM Integration**
```
CSW UI → Platform → External Systems
  → Kafka: Real-time event streaming (recommended)
  → Syslog: UDP/TCP syslog to SIEM
  → Data types: Flows, alerts, vulnerabilities, process events

SIEM use cases from CSW data:
  → Threat hunting: Cross-correlate CSW flows with EDR alerts
  → Compliance reporting: Automated evidence package generation
  → Trend analysis: Vulnerability posture over time
  → Anomaly correlation: CSW behavioral + identity + endpoint
```

**7b. ADM Continuous Improvement Loop**
```
Quarterly cycle:
  Month 1: Re-run ADM on all scopes
  Month 2: Delta analysis — new flows vs. previous ADM
            → New flows: Review and approve or block
            → Removed flows: Clean up stale policy rules
            → New attack surface: Tighten policy
  Month 3: Update policy workspace to reflect ADM delta
            → Retire stale rules
            → Add newly documented flows
            → Document changes for audit trail
```

**7c. Compliance Reporting Cadence**
```
Monthly:  Scope membership snapshot + policy change log
Quarterly: Vulnerability trend report + ADM delta + encryption compliance
Annual:   Full ZTA posture assessment + evidence package for auditors
```

**Evidence:** SIEM integration config, ADM delta report (quarterly), compliance posture report (annual)

## 3. NIST 800-207 Logical Components — CSW Mapping

| NIST 800-207 Component | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|
| Policy Engine (PE) | CSW policy engine — evaluates flows against allowlist rules |
| Policy Administrator (PA) | CSW policy workspace — authors and deploys policy decisions |
| Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) | CSW software sensor — enforces allow/deny per connection |
| CDM System (asset posture) | CSW vulnerability + process telemetry → SIEM feed |
| SIEM | CSW → Kafka/Syslog → enterprise SIEM |
| ID Management | CSW enforces auth path; IdP provides identity (complementary) |
| PKI | CSW enforces encrypted path; PKI manages certificates (complementary) |

---

## 4. Deployment Models — CSW Role

### Agent-Based ZTA (Primary CSW Model)
CSW software sensor on each workload = PEP at the workload level. Full visibility, process context, and enforcement. Best coverage of all seven tenets.

### Enclave-Based ZTA
CSW eliminates implicit intra-enclave trust. ADM validates every intra-enclave flow. Micro-segmentation enforces workload-level policy within the enclave. Prevents lateral movement that enclave-gateway-only models miss.

### Resource Portal-Based ZTA
CSW protects backend resources behind the portal. Enforces that ONLY the portal IP/workload can reach backend resources. Detects any direct-access bypass of the portal path — a critical security gap in portal-only deployments.
