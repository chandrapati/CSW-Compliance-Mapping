# Cisco Secure Workload — NERC CIP (North American Bulk Electric System)
## Technical Runbook | Electric Utilities & Generation/Transmission Operators

**Version:** 1.0 (draft — pending SME review) | **Standards:** NERC CIP-002 through CIP-014 (current effective revisions) | **Audience:** Bulk Electric System (BES) responsible entities and their security teams | **Environment:** IT estate supporting OT (corporate IT, engineering workstations, jump servers, historian/MES tier — *not* the OT control devices themselves)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Registered Entities under the NERC Reliability
Standards (Generation Owners/Operators, Transmission Owners/Operators,
Balancing Authorities, Reliability Coordinators, Distribution Providers
where applicable), and the cybersecurity teams preparing them for
NERC/Regional Entity audit cycles or for self-certification.

**Scope boundary you must understand before reading further.** Cisco
Secure Workload (CSW) is a workload-protection and segmentation
platform for **IT estate** — servers, virtual machines, containers,
and cloud workloads. CSW does **not** enforce policy on PLCs, RTUs,
relays, IEDs, HMIs, or any other Level 0–2 OT device. CSW's NERC CIP
contribution is specifically at the **IT-side of the IT/OT boundary
and within the EACMS (Electronic Access Control or Monitoring Systems)
and PACS (Physical Access Control Systems) supporting infrastructure**
— jump hosts, engineering workstations, historian/MES databases,
patch repositories, vendor-access servers, identity/PKI services, and
the corporate IT systems that touch BES Cyber System Information
(BCSI). Treat anything below the segmented boundary as out of scope
for CSW; reference your ICS/SCADA security stack and your physical
network architecture for those layers.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *CIP-005-7 R1 (ESP boundary): can I prove that the only inbound and
  outbound communications to my Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP)
  go through the documented Electronic Access Points (EAPs), and that
  no undocumented lateral path exists from corporate IT to the ESP?*
- *CIP-005-7 R2 (Interactive Remote Access, IRA): can I produce
  evidence that every IRA session terminates at the documented
  Intermediate System and that no direct corporate-IT-to-ESP pivot is
  reachable, with a forensic trail per session?*
- *CIP-007-6 R1 (Ports and Services): for every Cyber Asset within an
  ESP and for the EACMS supporting it, can I show only network-
  accessible ports and services that are actually needed, and produce
  the evidence quarterly?*
- *CIP-007-6 R3 (Malicious Code Prevention) and R4 (Security Event
  Monitoring): can I demonstrate event monitoring at the workload
  level for at least the EACMS/PACS/PCA tier, and reconstruct the
  process and flow context of an event?*
- *CIP-010-4 R1 (Configuration Change Management): can I produce an
  inventory baseline (R1.1) for every Cyber Asset including software
  installed (R1.1.5) and ports/services (R1.1.4), and detect
  unauthorised change (R1.5)?*
- *CIP-010-4 R3 (Vulnerability Assessments): can I produce the active
  vulnerability assessment evidence for High/Medium-impact BES Cyber
  Systems on the R3.1 cadence, and the paper assessment for low-
  impact?*
- *CIP-013-2 R1 (Supply Chain Risk Management): for the IT systems
  that interact with vendor-supplied software, can I show what those
  systems are actually talking to externally, and detect when that
  pattern changes?*

**What you'll need.** Your current CIP-002 BES Cyber System
identification list (with high/medium/low impact rating per Attachment
1), your ESP and PSP inventory under CIP-005/006, your EACMS and PACS
inventory, your CIP-010 baseline configuration register, and your
Cyber Vulnerability Assessment cadence per CIP-010 R3. CSW will
augment but not replace these governance artefacts.

**Where to start.** Section 2 if you are scoping CSW relative to
CIP-002 categorisation; sections 3–4 if you are designing the IT-side
of the ESP boundary; section 5 if EACMS hardening and IRA evidence
are the audit gap; section 6 if CIP-007 ports/services and CIP-010
baseline drift are the open items; section 9 if supply-chain (CIP-013)
visibility is the priority.

**Important.** NERC CIP enforcement actions are issued by the Regional
Entities under FERC oversight. Nothing in this runbook substitutes for
your CIP Senior Manager's accountability under CIP-003 or for the
RSAW/audit response your Regional Entity will request. CSW gives the
Senior Manager the *evidence* needed to defend the programme; it does
not author the programme.

## 1. Overview

NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards
govern cybersecurity for the Bulk Electric System (BES) across North
America. The standards apply to Registered Entities and to the BES
Cyber Systems they own or operate. The current standards in scope for
this runbook are:

| Standard | Topic | CSW relevance |
|---|---|---|
| CIP-002 | BES Cyber System Categorization | Inventory + scope labelling supporting categorisation evidence |
| CIP-003 | Security Management Controls | Quarterly evidence pack to CIP Senior Manager |
| CIP-004 | Personnel & Training | Out of scope — HR/training process |
| CIP-005 | Electronic Security Perimeters & IRA | **Direct** — segmentation, EAP enforcement, IRA termination evidence |
| CIP-006 | Physical Security | Out of scope — physical/PACS process |
| CIP-007 | System Security Management | **Direct** — ports/services, malicious code, security event monitoring |
| CIP-008 | Incident Reporting & Response | Forensic flow + process telemetry for incident reconstruction |
| CIP-009 | Recovery Plans | Policy/baseline export for DR; out-of-scope for active recovery |
| CIP-010 | Configuration Change Management & VA | **Direct** — baseline, drift, vulnerability assessment |
| CIP-011 | Information Protection (BCSI) | Egress monitoring on BCSI-hosting systems |
| CIP-013 | Supply Chain Risk Management | Vendor-system egress visibility on the IT side |
| CIP-014 | Physical Security (transmission) | Out of scope — physical/CCTV |

**Where CSW fits — the short version.** CSW is the segmentation and
visibility layer for the **IT estate** that surrounds, supports, and
crosses the boundary into ESPs. The Cyber Assets *inside* the ESP
(particularly Level 0–2 OT devices) typically remain under your
ICS/SCADA cybersecurity stack and the network-firewall-as-EAP
arrangement at the ESP boundary. CSW supplements that arrangement on
the IT side: it segments the EACMS (jump hosts, AD, PKI, vendor-access
servers), it enforces deny-by-default for the corporate-IT-to-ESP
path, it produces CIP-007/010 evidence at workload granularity, and
it monitors BCSI-hosting systems under CIP-011.

**Where CSW does not fit.** CSW is not certified as an EAP, is not an
ICS-aware deep-packet-inspection engine for protocols like DNP3, IEC
61850, or Modbus, and does not enforce policy on the OT devices
themselves. Your firewall vendor's EAP and your OT-specific monitoring
(Claroty, Nozomi, Dragos, Cisco Cyber Vision, etc.) remain the
primary controls there. CSW's role is the IT-side companion.

---

## 2. CIP-002 — BES Cyber System Categorization

CIP-002 R1 requires identification of BES Cyber Systems and impact
rating per Attachment 1 (High / Medium / Low). The output is the
authoritative scope for everything in CIP-003 through CIP-013.

**CSW does not perform CIP-002 categorisation.** That is a
risk-and-engineering decision driven by Attachment 1 criteria
(generation MW thresholds, blackstart, control centres, etc.). CSW
*does* host the labels that downstream CIP processes rely on.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Receive the categorisation outputs from CIP-002 owners
  → Per Cyber Asset: bes_impact = high | medium | low
  → Per BES Cyber System: bcs_id, bcs_name, bcs_function

Step 2: Apply consistent labels to every CSW-managed workload that
        either *is* a CIP-relevant Cyber Asset or *supports* one
        (EACMS, PACS, PCA, BCSI host)
  CSW UI → Inventory → Bulk Label
  Mandatory labels:
    bes_impact:   high | medium | low | n/a
    bes_role:     bcs | eacms | pacs | pca | bcsi-host | corporate-it
    bcs_id:       [reference to your CIP-002 register entry]
    esp_member:   true | false
    facility:     [station/plant name]
    region:       [Regional Entity scope: WECC | NPCC | RF | SERC | TRE | MRO]

Step 3: Build CSW Scopes per (region, facility, bes_role)
  CSW UI → Organize → Scopes → New
  → Recommended hierarchy:
        Root
        └── BES-Estate
            ├── EACMS
            │   ├── Jump-Hosts
            │   ├── Vendor-Access-Hosts
            │   ├── Identity-and-PKI
            │   └── Patch-Repositories
            ├── BCSI-Hosts
            │   ├── Engineering-Workstations
            │   ├── Historians
            │   └── Document-Repositories
            ├── PACS-Supporting-IT
            └── Corporate-IT (everything else, default-deny target)

Step 4: Validate scope membership against the CIP-002 register
  → Cross-check CSW count vs. the register; reconcile any delta with
    the BES Cyber System Asset Owner before formal sign-off
```

**Evidence:** Per-scope membership snapshot (CSV) with workload
identity, OS, owner, BCS reference, ESP membership flag, and last-
seen timestamp. This becomes the IT-side companion to your CIP-002
identification list.

## 3. CIP-005 R1 — Electronic Security Perimeter (ESP) Boundary

CIP-005 R1 requires the ESP to surround every Cyber Asset designated
as part of a BES Cyber System (per the applicability matrix).
Communication crossing the ESP must be through documented Electronic
Access Points (EAPs), and only if necessary.

**Architectural reality.** Your ESP boundary firewalls (the EAPs)
remain the controlling artefact for the ESP perimeter itself. CSW
contributes by ensuring *the IT-side of that boundary is itself
segmented*, so that a compromised corporate-IT host cannot reach the
EAP from an undocumented direction.

**CSW Implementation — IT-side ESP enclave segmentation:**
```
Step 1: Define the IT-side ESP enclave policy workspace
  CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation → New Workspace
  Name: nerc-cip-esp-it-side-{facility}
  Scope: facility = {facility} AND bes_role IN (eacms, bcsi-host)

Step 2: Compute the as-observed baseline via ADM
  Run ADM ≥ 14 days; capture month-end maintenance windows
  Reject "noise" clusters; rename clusters to BES-relevant roles

Step 3: Layer CIP-aligned hardening rules on top of the baseline
  DENY:  Corporate-IT → EAP-IP-set
         (only documented hosts may reach the EAP firewall pair)
  DENY:  Corporate-IT → BCSI-hosts
         (engineering workstations and historians get a managed gateway)
  DENY:  EACMS → Internet
         (jump hosts, AD, PKI never directly egress to the public
          internet)
  ALLOW: Vendor-Access-Hosts → vendor-allowlisted FQDNs only
         (covers CIP-013 R1.2.5 and R1.2.6 vendor remote access path)
  LOG:   Any unmatched flow inbound to EACMS or BCSI-hosts
         (becomes a CIP-008 candidate event)

Step 4: Run in Simulation for ≥ 30 days
  → Resolve every legitimate-but-blocked flow with the asset owner;
    document each exception in the workspace notes for the audit
    trail referenced from CIP-005 R1.5.

Step 5: Promote to Enforce; gate by change-management approval
  → Each subsequent change captured in CSW change history; this is
    the IT-side complement to your CIP-005 R1 documentation.
```

**Evidence:** (a) workspace export per facility; (b) simulation→
enforcement transition log; (c) quarterly enforcement diff report
delivered to the CIP Senior Manager.

## 4. CIP-005 R2 — Interactive Remote Access (IRA)

CIP-005 R2 requires IRA to terminate at an Intermediate System with
multi-factor authentication and encryption. The Intermediate System
is itself a Cyber Asset and inherits the protections of its impact
rating.

**CSW Implementation — Intermediate System enforcement:**
```
Step 1: Identify the Intermediate System(s) in CSW
  → Apply label: ira_intermediate = true; bes_role = eacms

Step 2: Build the IRA-only ingress policy
  ALLOW: {your-MFA-VPN-pool} → ira_intermediate = true
         (port 443 / 22 / 3389 as documented)
  DENY:  Any → ira_intermediate = false (when accessed via the IRA
         path)

Step 3: Build the IRA-only egress policy from the Intermediate System
  ALLOW: ira_intermediate = true → {documented BES Cyber Asset set}
         (port + protocol per the CIP-005 R2 Part 2.2 documentation)
  DENY:  ira_intermediate = true → Internet
         (no direct internet from a jump host; covers CIP-005 R2.2)

Step 4: Capture session telemetry for forensics
  → CSW retains every flow with byte counts and process attribution
  → Pair with your IRA recording solution (Bastion logs, terminal
    recording) — CSW is the network-side complement, not a session
    recorder

Step 5: Schedule weekly IRA-pattern review
  → Generate report: every flow originating from ira_intermediate = true
    grouped by destination workload, port, and observation count
  → CIP-005 R2 evidence: artefact dated within the audit window
```

**Evidence:** (a) IRA workspace policy export; (b) weekly IRA-flow
report; (c) any anomaly events from the unmatched-flow log.

---

## 5. CIP-007 R1 — Ports and Services

CIP-007 R1.1 requires that for every applicable Cyber Asset, only
network-accessible logical ports and services that are needed are
enabled.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Inventory observed listening services per workload
  CSW UI → Investigate → Inventory → Workload → Open Ports
  → For each EACMS / BCSI-host:
        Listening port set
        Process bound to each port
        Network reachability scope (who currently reaches it)

Step 2: Cross-reference against CIP-007 R1.1 baseline
  → For every observed listening port, confirm:
        (a) it's in the documented baseline;
        (b) it's actually used (CSW shows last-flow timestamp);
        (c) the source set is intentional and documented.

Step 3: Generate the quarterly evidence pack
  → CSW report: per-workload listening-port inventory with last-
    observed-flow timestamp
  → Ports with no flow in 90+ days = candidate for closure under
    R1.1; route to Cyber Asset Owner for review.
  → Ports with unexpected source set = candidate exception or
    misconfiguration; raise as CIP-007 R2 patching/configuration
    finding before audit.

Step 4: Enforce port-level allowlist where possible
  → For EACMS not requiring broad reachability, add CSW policy that
    explicitly allows only the documented source set per port; deny
    everything else with audit logging.
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-workload listening-port inventory dated
quarterly; (b) source-set policy for each documented port; (c)
delta report between quarters.

## 6. CIP-007 R3 & R4 — Malicious Code Prevention and Security Event Monitoring

CIP-007 R3 requires deployment of methods to deter, detect, or prevent
malicious code. R4 requires logging of security events at the Cyber
Asset level (or the BES Cyber System level for low-impact).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enable behavioural / process-based detections on CSW-managed
        workloads
  CSW UI → Defend → Forensics → Rules
  → Out-of-the-box rules: privilege escalation, persistence, lateral
    movement, suspicious child processes
  → Custom rules: encode CIP-relevant abuse patterns
        Example: "Process on EACMS host writes to startup paths"
        Example: "Outbound to non-allowlisted FQDN from BCSI host"
        Example: "Execution of new binary not in baseline on jump host"

Step 2: Wire alerts to the SOC and to the CIP-008 incident process
  CSW UI → Manage → Data Tap → SIEM
  → Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel, Cisco XDR
  → Tag every alert with bes_impact and bcs_id so the SOC can route
    per Attachment 1 impact rating.

Step 3: Retain the per-event evidence for the CIP-007 R4 retention
        period (90 calendar days minimum unless your Regional Entity
        directs longer)
  → CSW keeps full flow + process context; export weekly to your
    long-term log store.

Step 4: Map detection-to-control coverage explicitly
  → CSW behavioural rule set → CIP-007 R3.1 (deter), R3.2 (detect),
    R3.3 (prevent — via simulation→enforce policy progression)
  → Document the mapping; this is the artefact your auditor will
    accept as your "method" under R3.
```

**Evidence:** (a) detection rule catalogue with last-modified dates
and CIP control coverage; (b) SIEM forwarding configuration
screenshot; (c) sample alert with full forensic context for at
least one event per quarter.

---

## 7. CIP-008 — Incident Reporting and Response Planning

CIP-008-6 R1.4 requires identification, classification, and response
plans for Cyber Security Incidents. R2 and R3 cover testing and
review. R4 added the reportable Cyber Security Incident notification
requirement.

**CSW Implementation — Incident Reconstruction Bundle:**
```
For each Cyber Security Incident on a CSW-managed workload, assemble:

  (a) Affected workload set
      → Inventory query: hostnames, IPs, OS, BCS labels, ESP membership

  (b) Time-anchored flow record
      → CSW historical conversations: source, destination, port, byte
        counts, timestamps, process attribution

  (c) Process activity record
      → Every process spawned on affected workloads in the window

  (d) Software footprint at time of incident
      → Package list, CVE exposure at that moment (not "today")

  (e) Containment evidence
      → Quarantine policy applied; flow drop count after policy;
        time-to-quarantine

  (f) Configuration baseline diff
      → CIP-010 R1.5 unauthorised-change candidate evidence

These six artefacts populate the incident dossier your CIP-008
process and your E-ISAC notification (when applicable under R4)
will draw from.
```

**Evidence:** (a) standard incident dossier template; (b) MTTD/MTTR
metrics by impact rating; (c) annual aggregate incident-trend
report for the CIP Senior Manager (CIP-003 R1.1 input).

---

## 8. CIP-010 — Configuration Change Management & Vulnerability Assessments

### 8.1 R1 — Configuration Change Management

CIP-010-4 R1.1 requires a baseline configuration including operating
system or firmware (R1.1.1), commercially-installed software (R1.1.2),
custom-installed software (R1.1.3), logical network-accessible ports
(R1.1.4), and security patches (R1.1.5). R1.5 requires monitoring for
unauthorised change.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Capture the baseline per CSW-managed workload
  CSW UI → Investigate → Inventory → Workload → Software & Packages
  → Auto-captured: OS, kernel, package list, version, install date
  → Schedule daily snapshot to CSW data tap or external store

Step 2: Add the CIP-010 R1.1.4 ports view to the same baseline
  → CSW already inventories listening ports per workload (see §5)
  → Snapshot the listening-port state alongside the package list

Step 3: Detect unauthorised change (R1.5)
  → CSW report: daily diff between today and yesterday's package list
  → CSW report: daily diff in listening ports
  → Each diff routes to:
        - Authorised? → record as expected change in your CMR
        - Unauthorised? → CIP-010 R1.5 evidence + CIP-008 candidate

Step 4: Tie the change record back to your change-management ticket
  → Correlate the CSW-detected change timestamp against your CM
    ticketing system (Remedy/ServiceNow/etc.); orphan changes are
    the unauthorised-change candidates.
```

**Evidence:** (a) baseline export per workload (R1.1); (b) daily
diff log with disposition (authorised vs. unauthorised); (c)
quarterly summary delivered to the CIP Senior Manager.

### 8.2 R3 — Vulnerability Assessments

CIP-010-4 R3.1 (active VA on Highs every 15 calendar months; paper
VA on Mediums and Lows on different cadences per Part 3) and R3.2
(prior to commissioning Highs/Mediums) define the VA programme.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous CVE inventory at workload level
  CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Per-workload CVE list with CVSS, exploit availability, EPSS score
  → Filter by bes_impact = high → highest-priority remediation queue

Step 2: Generate the active-VA evidence (R3.1) for High-impact assets
  → Quarterly CVE export tied to remediation ticket IDs
  → Includes: discovery date, severity, exploit-in-the-wild status,
    patch availability, applied-by date

Step 3: Generate the paper-VA evidence (R3.1) for Medium-impact assets
  → CSW vulnerability inventory exported on the documented cadence;
    the paper review combines this with vendor advisories you track
    out of band

Step 4: Pre-commissioning VA (R3.2)
  → For new High/Medium-impact workloads, run CSW first-sighting
    inventory before connection to the ESP
  → Export VA result; gate connection on remediation or accepted-risk
    documentation
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-asset CVE list dated to satisfy R3.1 cadence;
(b) remediation tracking with ticket IDs; (c) pre-commissioning VA
artefact per new asset.

---

## 9. CIP-013 — Supply Chain Risk Management (IT-side)

CIP-013-2 R1 requires a documented supply chain cyber security risk
management plan. R1.2 covers procurement, R1.2.5 covers vendor remote
access, R1.2.6 covers coordination of vendor responses to incidents.

**Where CSW fits.** CSW gives you the *technical evidence* layer for
the vendor remote access portion (R1.2.5) and for ongoing vendor
egress monitoring on the IT side. The procurement and contractual
elements (R1.1, the bulk of R1.2) remain governance/legal work.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enumerate every vendor-egress destination from EACMS workloads
  CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  Filter: source_scope ⊂ EACMS AND destination_ip ∉ internal_ranges
  → Group by destination FQDN/IP; rank by byte count, frequency
  → Output: technical view of vendor dependency per EACMS host

Step 2: Reconcile against your vendor register
  → For each observed external endpoint, find the corresponding
    vendor in your CIP-013 R1 register; flag missing endpoints

Step 3: Enforce egress allowlisting for vendor-access hosts
  ALLOW: vendor-access-hosts → {register-listed vendor endpoints}
  DENY:  vendor-access-hosts → all other external destinations
  → New vendor usage now requires register update before deployment

Step 4: Continuous monitoring
  → CSW alert: "new external destination from EACMS host"
  → Routes to the supply-chain risk owner for register reconciliation
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-EACMS vendor-egress report; (b) register-vs-
observed delta report; (c) egress policy enforcement diff history.

> **Caveat.** A vendor's *internal* posture is out of scope for CSW
> unless the vendor also runs CSW within their environment. CIP-013
> contractual provisions remain the primary control for vendor
> behaviour outside your perimeter.

---

## 10. CIP-011 — Information Protection (BCSI)

CIP-011-3 protects BES Cyber System Information (BCSI) — typically
network diagrams, configuration files, vulnerability assessment
results, security plans, and similar artefacts. The 2022 revision
(CIP-011-3) expanded protections to BCSI in third-party-hosted
storage.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Identify BCSI-hosting workloads
  → Document repository servers, SharePoint, internal wikis hosting
    network diagrams, config archives, VA results
  → Apply label: bes_role = bcsi-host

Step 2: Egress monitoring on BCSI hosts
  → CSW continuous flow analysis: every outbound from a BCSI-host
    workload, grouped by destination + byte volume
  → Alert on any new external destination

Step 3: Access pattern monitoring on BCSI hosts
  → Detect unusual access volumes (large pulls, off-hours, unusual
    source identities)
  → Pair CSW telemetry with your DLP/identity stack — CSW is the
    network-side complement, not the data-classification engine

Step 4: For cloud-hosted BCSI (CIP-011-3 R1.2 scope), use CSW Cloud
        Connectors to inventory access patterns to the cloud storage
        endpoint from your IT estate
```

**Evidence:** (a) BCSI-host inventory; (b) egress pattern report;
(c) anomaly alert log with disposition.

NERC CIP shares substantial control surface with:

  800-53 analogues (AC-3, AC-4, SC-7, SI-4, RA-5, CM-2, CM-3, CM-7,
  AU-2, IR-4 cover the bulk of CIP-005/007/008/010). See

## 14. Disclaimer

This runbook is **draft v1** describing how Cisco Secure Workload
capabilities can support a NERC CIP programme on the IT side of the
IT/OT boundary. It is **not** legal or regulatory advice and does
not constitute a finding of compliance. Specifically:

- Final identification and categorisation of BES Cyber Systems
  (CIP-002), the design of ESP and EAP arrangements (CIP-005),
  determination of impact ratings (Attachment 1), and the formal
  CIP audit response remain the responsibility of the Registered
  Entity's CIP Senior Manager and qualified compliance counsel.
- CSW does not enforce policy on PLCs, RTUs, IEDs, HMIs, or any
  other Level 0–2 OT device, and is not certified as an Electronic
  Access Point (EAP).
- Always validate against the **current effective revision** of each
  CIP standard published on the NERC web site, against your Regional
  Entity's audit guidance, and against any FERC orders amending
  applicability or compliance dates.

This document should receive subject-matter-expert review for both
NERC CIP regulatory accuracy and current Cisco product capability
before being relied upon in a formal compliance engagement.
