"""
Generate customer-facing DOCX, HTML, and PDF reports for the framework
runbooks that are Markdown-first in this repository.

The DOCX and HTML outputs use pandoc. The PDF output intentionally uses a small
stdlib-only writer so the repo does not require LaTeX, wkhtmltopdf, or reportlab.

Each framework entry carries an explicit topic-to-CSW-capability map and an
evidence-collection table so the report mirrors what an SE / assessor would
actually need rather than a generic bullet list. Specific CSW UI navigation is
intentionally not included; framework-specific CSW UI paths are on the Cisco
product roadmap, and this report references CSW capabilities and the evidence
artifacts they produce.

## Customer-Facing Compliance Report

## Framework Version Note

{item['version_note']}

## CSW UI Navigation Note

Cisco does not yet publish framework-specific CSW UI navigation for this standard; framework-specific navigation is on the product roadmap. This report references CSW *capabilities* and the *evidence artifacts* they produce. The technical runbook (`{item['runbook_filename']}`) in this folder contains the deeper engineering detail.

---

## Executive Summary

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) supports a defined subset of this framework. The strongest customer story is not that CSW "certifies" compliance; it is that CSW turns workload communication and inventory into evidence that the customer, the customer's compliance team, and the customer's assessor can review. This report describes which framework topics CSW supports, which it does not, what evidence artifacts CSW produces, and how often the customer should collect them. CSW does **not** replace the customer's governance, policy, or assessor judgement, and this report is **not** a control attestation.

## Suggested CSW Scope Pattern

```
{item['scope_pattern']}
```

This scope pattern should be validated with the customer's architecture, application owners, compliance team, and assessor before it is used for formal evidence.

## In Scope for CSW Evidence

## Framework Topic → CSW Capability Map

{topic_table}

## Evidence Collection Approach

The table below describes per-topic evidence collection - what to collect, the CSW source area, and a suggested cadence. The cadence should be tuned to the customer's audit cycle, regulatory cadence, and risk appetite.

{evidence_table}

## POV / Workshop Approach

1. Confirm the framework version and assessment cycle with the customer's compliance team.
2. Select one business service, regulated boundary, or critical workload group to start with; do not attempt to instrument the entire estate in the POV.
3. Validate workload coverage and install sensors or configure supported connectors. Document the cannot-instrument register; this is itself evidence.
4. Apply labels for application, environment, owner, data class, criticality, compliance scope, and any framework-specific tags (e.g. `tenant`, `prototype`, `isa_level`, `npi`, `cui`, `ephi`).
5. Observe flows over a representative business window. Minimum two weeks; longer if the customer has month-end, quarterly, or seasonal cycles relevant to the scope.
6. Use ADM to generate a candidate policy. Review with the application owner. Run in Simulation mode for at least two weeks before any enforcement.
7. Package inventory, scope, flows, policy, exceptions, and known gaps as the evidence output. Cross-reference this report's evidence collection table with the customer's existing audit work-papers.

## Boundaries and Complementary Controls

{item['boundaries']}

## Assessor / Auditor Caveat

CSW provides technical evidence inputs. The customer's qualified assessor, auditor, certifying body, or regulator determines compliance status. Validate all framework-topic mappings, control IDs, paragraph references, and section numbers in this report against the current official framework text. If the customer is being assessed against a version other than the one referenced in the framework version note above, revalidate before use.

## Disclaimer

This report is for informational and planning purposes. It is not legal, regulatory, audit, or certification advice. Validate all mappings against the current official framework text, the customer's environment, and qualified compliance, legal, and audit professionals.
