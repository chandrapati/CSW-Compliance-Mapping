## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](../docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](../docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

{highlights}

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.
