# Cisco Secure Workload — Compliance Reference Designs & Reports

![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=chandrapati.CSW-Compliance-Mapping&left_text=visitors)

Customer-facing reports and matching **reference designs** that map Cisco
Secure Workload (CSW) controls to **thirty-four** compliance, sector, and
zero-trust frameworks. Every framework folder ships the same set of
assets: a Markdown **reference design** (the engineering view — architecture
intent, configuration steps, sample policies, and the exact evidence
exports), a DOCX report (the editable customer master), a PDF render of
that report, and HTML versions of both for browser/mobile reading.

> **New here?** Read [Background — What is Cisco Secure Workload?](./docs/about-csw.md)
> for a one-page intro to the platform itself, then come back to pick a
> framework.

## Executive overview — 60-second read

> **For a CISO / CIO skimming this for the first time.**

- **What this is.** A reference library that maps Cisco Secure Workload
  (CSW) capabilities to **34 security, regulatory, and zero-trust
  frameworks** — so you can see *which* controls CSW helps you evidence,
  and *how*, before committing budget or audit hours.
- **What you get per framework.** Two paired documents — a **reference
  design** (the engineering view: architecture intent, configuration
  steps, sample policies, and the exact evidence exports) and a
  **customer-facing report** (the assessor-ready narrative built on that
  work) — each in Markdown, DOCX, PDF, and HTML. Each framework also has
  its own standalone [Reference Design repo](#per-framework-reference-designs)
  with a full CSW build guide, per-control evidence table, and POV plan.
- **The core idea.** CSW turns live workload behaviour — *who talks to
  whom, on which port, via which process, and what changed* — into
  micro-segmentation, drift tracking, and forensic-grade flow evidence.
  The same evidence answers the **auditor** ("prove the control still
  holds, not just on audit day") and the **incident responder** ("what
  moved laterally, and what changed"). That overlap is why segmentation
  shows up across PCI, HIPAA, NIST, DORA, NIS2, and the zero-trust models.
- **Where to start.** New to CSW → [compliance evidence
  playbook](./docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md). Hunting a specific
  control → [`INDEX.md`](./INDEX.md). Choosing a framework → the
  [asset library](#asset-library) table below. Want one framework in its
  own shareable repo → the [per-framework reference
  designs](#per-framework-reference-designs) index.
- **Read this before relying on it.** These mappings are **informational
  reference only** — not legal, audit, or completeness advice. They
  require **SME review** against current official sources and your
  assessors. Note the explicitly-labelled drafts and proposals: **HIPAA
  2025 NPRM** is a *proposed* rule; **CIS / CSF 2.0 / CMMC 2.0** and
  **NERC CIP / TSA Pipeline** are *draft v1* cross-framework or
  IT-side sector overlays. See the full [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## Why these mappings exist

Compliance frameworks were written by humans trying to describe what
"good security" looks like for a class of risk. They are *outcomes*,
not products. The hardest question a customer faces is not *"what does
the standard require?"* — it's *"for the workloads I actually defend,
can I actually prove — with evidence that survives scrutiny — that the
control still holds tomorrow, not just on audit day?"*

These mappings exist to close that gap. For each framework, they trace
specific controls (e.g. PCI DSS Req 1.2.1, HIPAA §164.312(a)(1), NIST
AC-4) to concrete CSW capabilities — micro-segmentation, process-level
telemetry, software inventory, vulnerability awareness, forensic flow
data, and authored workload policy — and explain how those capabilities
can contribute evidence for assessor review when deployed in scope.

The same workload-resident evidence that can support an auditor's review also
shortens the questions defenders ask under pressure: *what was talking
to what, on which port, via which process, and what changed?* That
overlap is not a coincidence — it's why segmentation, lateral-movement
visibility, and patching priority show up across PCI Req 1, HIPAA
§164.312, NIST AC-4, ISO A.8.22, DORA Art. 9, NIS2 Art. 21(2)(j) and the
zero-trust frameworks. Standards writers captured the failure modes
people keep living through; treating those obligations as audit
busywork forfeits blast-radius containment while still paying for the
programme.

For the longer argument — including the five conversation-starter
questions worth walking through against your own environment — see
[Why these mappings matter](./docs/why-these-mappings-matter.md).

## How the mapping works

![Cisco Secure Workload Compliance Mapping Architecture](csw-compliance-architecture.png)

*The same Secure Workload capabilities — micro-segmentation, process & flow telemetry, software inventory & CVE awareness, forensic flow evidence, and authored workload policy — are mapped, control by control, to 34 compliance and zero-trust frameworks. Each framework folder pairs an engineering reference design with a customer-facing report so the same live evidence answers both the auditor and the incident responder.*

## Per-framework reference designs

Prefer a focused, shareable repo for a single framework? Every one of the
**34 frameworks** below now has its own standalone **Reference Design**
repo, built to the same template so an evaluator can pick up any one of
them and know exactly what they are looking at:

- a hero overview and a **coverage snapshot** — Direct / Supporting / Evidence Required;
- a **reference architecture** diagram and an **evidence-flow** diagram (rendered natively on GitHub);
- a **step-by-step CSW build** — scopes → ADM → Monitor → Simulate → Enforce;
- a **requirement-by-requirement evidence table** naming the exact CSW export per control;
- a **POV / validation plan** and an **evidence checklist**; and
- the customer-facing **compliance report** (PDF / DOCX / HTML) with official framework citations.

> This repository stays the **full library + umbrella index**; the
> per-framework repos are the lightweight front-ends you can hand to one
> customer, assessor, or evaluator. The coverage language is deliberately
> conservative — **Direct** evidence is still evidence, not a pass, and
> every design calls out where another control owner still has to file.

## Governance baseline

These assets are **evidence mappings**, not compliance attestations. Use the
[Governance and Evidence Standards](./docs/governance-and-evidence-standards.md)
to record whether CSW makes a direct or supporting evidence contribution,
where complementary controls are required, and which party owns each control.
Customer-specific exports, credentials, raw diagnostic bundles, and unredacted
evidence belong in the customer-approved evidence system—not in this repository.

The library contains both legacy hand-authored reports and generated report
assets. Treat every customer-facing artifact as **draft unless marked
SME-reviewed** for the applicable framework edition, CSW release, deployment
scope, and shared-responsibility model.

## Asset library

**Coverage** highlights what each framework section addresses so the
whole library can be scanned in one view. The **Reference design** column
comes first because the reference design is what proves the mapping is real
and not marketing — it shows the actual architecture intent, configuration
steps, sample policies, and evidence collection. The **Report** column is the
customer-facing narrative built on top of that work. Format links open the
asset directly; pick whichever fits the conversation you're in (see the
[audience and usage guide](./docs/audience-and-usage.md) for when to
reach for the reference design vs. the report).

## Licensing

This repository ships with Cisco's standard terms in
[`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) at the repo root — read before redistributing,
forking commercially, or building derivative artefacts outside your
organisation.

## Disclaimer

The compliance mappings in this repository are derived from public
standards and regulatory framework documents (HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI DSS,
NIST SP 800-series, ISO/IEC 27001, CISA ZTMM, FIPS 140, EU DORA,
EU NIS2, NERC CIP, TSA Pipeline Security Directives, CIS Critical
Security Controls v8.1, NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, CMMC 2.0,
IEC 62443, GDPR, MITRE ATT&CK, FedRAMP, SWIFT CSCF, HITRUST CSF,
NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 3, CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4, COBIT 2019,
ACSC Essential Eight, UK Cyber Essentials Plus, the HIPAA Security
Rule 2025 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), MAS Technology Risk
Management Guidelines, APRA CPS 234, NY DFS 23 NYCRR Part 500, TISAX /
VDA ISA, NIST SP 800-82, and BSI C5
cross-referenced against documented Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)
product capabilities at the time of authoring.

The **HIPAA 2025 NPRM** technical mapping interprets a **proposed**
Security Rule update and must be reconciled against **final** regulatory
text before formal reliance; continue parallel compliance with the
**current** Security Rule until amendments are effective.

The **NERC CIP** and **TSA Pipeline** mappings are explicitly scoped
to the **IT side of the IT/OT boundary** and are issued as **draft
v1**. Treat them as sector overlays on the underlying NIST family
rather than as standalone audit references.

The **CIS Controls v8.1**, **NIST CSF 2.0**, and **CMMC 2.0**
mappings are issued as **draft v1** and are *cross-mapping*
frameworks that intentionally overlap with the underlying NIST
families already in this library. CMMC Level 2 assessment is
performed by a Certified Third-Party Assessor Organisation (C3PAO);
nothing in this repository substitutes for the System Security Plan
(SSP), Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M), or the C3PAO engagement.

All mappings require subject-matter-expert review for both
regulatory / framework accuracy and current Cisco product capability
before being relied upon in a formal compliance engagement.

These materials are provided for **informational and reference purposes
only**. They do not constitute legal, regulatory, or audit advice, are
not warranted to be complete, current, or fit for any specific
compliance program, and should not be relied upon as a substitute for
review by your own qualified compliance, legal, and audit professionals.

Standards evolve, product capabilities change, and the applicability of
any specific control depends on each organization's environment,
deployment, and risk posture. Always validate against the latest
official source documents before formal use.

**Guidelines.** The capability bullets in
[Background — What is Cisco Secure Workload?](./docs/about-csw.md)
describe how teams commonly use Cisco Secure Workload. They are not a
completeness check for your estate — apply professional judgment, align
with your assessors, and tailor to how you run operations.

For questions, scoping discussions, or to validate how these mappings
apply to your environment, please contact your **Cisco account team**.
