# Cisco Secure Workload — MAS Technology Risk Management Guidelines
## Technical Runbook | Singapore Financial Institutions

**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Technology Risk Management Guidelines (January 2021)  
**Use Case:** Critical-system segmentation, technology asset inventory, third-party / outsourcing visibility, cyber security operations evidence

> **Framework version note.** This runbook references the MAS TRM Guidelines published in January 2021, which remain the current published version at the time of writing. Validate against the latest MAS publication before using this runbook in a supervisory or audit context.
>
> **CSW UI navigation note.** Cisco does not yet publish framework-specific CSW UI navigation for MAS TRM (it is on the product roadmap). This runbook references CSW *capabilities* and the *evidence artifacts* they produce. Where a specific CSW screen is named (e.g. "Inventory", "ADM workspace", "Policy workspace", "Flow Search", "Vulnerability Report"), it refers to the general-purpose CSW feature area, not a MAS-TRM-specific view.

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Singapore-licensed financial institutions and regulated financial-services providers (banks, finance companies, insurers, capital markets services licensees, payment services licensees) using the MAS TRM Guidelines as the technology risk baseline. Useful for the CISO function, technology risk officer, infrastructure leads, and the compliance / internal audit teams that prepare for MAS supervisory engagements.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Can I demonstrate controlled workload connectivity into and out of critical systems and customer-data environments?* (Access Control, Data and Infrastructure Security)
- *Can I produce technology asset evidence that aligns with the institution's CMDB and the technology risk register?* (Technology Risk Management Framework)
- *Can I evidence vulnerability handling priorities for workloads in scope of critical or customer-data services?* (Cyber Security Assessment)
- *Can I reconcile outsourced / third-party communication paths against approved technology risk boundaries?* (Management of IT Services / Outsourcing)
- *If an investigation is needed, can I rebuild a workload-level communication and process timeline for the affected systems?* (Cyber Security Operations / Incident Management)

**What you'll need.** Current critical-systems list, outsourcing register, CMDB or cloud asset inventory, network architecture diagram, vulnerability management process, monitoring/SIEM retention policy, application owner contacts, and the institution's technology risk register.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping a deployment; sections 5–7 if you are ready to design and simulate policy; sections 9–10 if you are preparing for a MAS supervisory engagement or internal audit within the next quarter.

## 1. Overview

The MAS TRM Guidelines are principle- and outcome-based supervisory guidance. They are not a control catalogue; they expect financial institutions to demonstrate that the technology risk management framework, including segmentation, monitoring, asset inventory, and incident response, is appropriate to the institution's risk profile.

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) can support **technical evidence** for the TRM topics that depend on workload-level visibility, segmentation, policy enforcement, vulnerability context, telemetry, and forensic flow data. CSW does **not** replace MAS-level governance, board / senior management accountability, the technology risk management framework itself, BCP/DR, IAM, cryptography programme decisions, outsourcing due diligence, or regulatory notification.

### MAS TRM Topics and CSW Relevance

| MAS TRM topic area | CSW relevance |
|---|---|
| Technology Risk Management Framework | Workload inventory, labels, scopes, application identification |
| Management of IT Services (incl. outsourcing) | Third-party / outsourced service egress visibility |
| IT Resilience | Approved-flow baseline as one input to resilience evidence |
| Access Control (network access layer) | Workload-level allowlist policy and audit |
| Data and Infrastructure Security | Micro-segmentation, plaintext-protocol detection |
| Cyber Security Operations | Flow / process telemetry, alerts, forensic search |
| Cyber Security Assessment | CVE / package exposure, reachability-informed prioritisation |
| IT Audit | Evidence packages from inventory, ADM, policy, and exception registers |

Topics that are **out of scope** for CSW evidence (and must be evidenced by other tools, processes, or controls): governance and board oversight, cryptography module assurance, IAM/PAM lifecycle, BCP/DR testing, fraud risk, customer due diligence, supplier assurance contracts, and MAS reporting decisions.

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW for a MAS-TRM-aligned use case, confirm:

- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-prem) provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Network reachability from workloads to the CSW cluster on the documented control-plane port
- [ ] Linux / Windows agent compatibility verified for representative critical systems
- [ ] Cloud provider accounts connected via CSW cloud connectors where critical systems run in cloud
- [ ] Critical systems list reviewed with the technology risk officer
- [ ] Stakeholders identified: CISO, Technology Risk Officer, Application Owner(s), Internal Audit lead
- [ ] Change management window approved for sensor / connector roll-out
- [ ] Evidence retention period agreed with internal audit and the technology risk team

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor & Connector Deployment (Days 1–5)

Deploy CSW telemetry sources without enforcement.

**Software sensor install (representative pattern):**

```text
Linux  (RHEL/CentOS/Ubuntu): install the CSW agent package distributed for the OS
Windows                    : install the signed CSW agent MSI
```

**Initial sensor configuration:**

- Enforcement Mode: **Monitoring Only** (no enforcement during Phase 1)
- Data collection: process context, network flow, package / vulnerability exposure (where supported by sensor type)
- Initial labels applied on Day 1: `env`, `data_class`, `criticality`, `application`, `owner`, `compliance=mas-trm`

**Cloud workload coverage (where applicable):**

- Add cloud provider accounts (AWS / Azure / GCP) as CSW cloud connectors with read-only inventory and flow telemetry
- Confirm tag-based scope inheritance from cloud tags (e.g. `application`, `environment`, `criticality`, `data_class`)
- Document any workloads that **cannot** be instrumented (e.g. third-party managed PaaS) in a `cannot-instrument` register; this register is itself evidence

**Sensor validation evidence:** sensor inventory export with status, version, and last-checkin timestamp. Retain as Phase 1 baseline.

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Inventory Design (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Suggested Scope Architecture

```
Root Scope
└── MAS-TRM
    ├── Critical-Systems
    │   ├── Digital-Banking
    │   ├── Payments
    │   ├── Trading
    │   └── Core-Platforms
    ├── Customer-Data
    │   ├── Data-Stores
    │   └── Analytics
    ├── Security-Services
    │   ├── Identity-and-PAM-Adjacent
    │   ├── Monitoring
    │   └── Patch-Management
    └── Outsourced-Third-Parties
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters

Build CSW inventory filters that auto-populate the scopes above. Examples:

```
Filter: Critical-Systems-Candidates
  - Hostname / DNS contains: "core", "payments", "trade", "ledger"
  - Tag (from CMDB sync): system_class = critical
  - Process / port listened: domain-specific (e.g. ISO 8583, FIX, custom payment ports)

Filter: Customer-Data-Stores
  - Listening process: mysqld, postgres, oracle, sqlserver, mongod
  - Listening port: 1521, 3306, 5432, 1433, 27017
  - Tag: data_class = customer

Filter: Outsourced-Third-Parties
  - Source/Destination outside on-prem and cloud allow-lists
  - Tag: managed_by = vendor
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters for MAS TRM |
|---|---|---|
| `application` | core-banking, payments-gateway, trading | Maps workloads to the institution's application register |
| `env` | production, uat, dev | Required to evidence segregation of environments |
| `data_class` | customer, internal, public | Supports data security and customer-information protection topics |
| `criticality` | critical, important, standard | Aligns to the institution's technology risk classification |
| `owner` | line-of-business, team | Accountability for control testing |
| `compliance` | mas-trm | Filters CSW evidence to MAS scope |
| `vendor` | <named vendor or "none"> | Maps to outsourcing register |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

### 5.1 ADM Configuration

For each scope in 4.1, create an ADM workspace and run it across a representative business window that includes month-end and any batch processing cycles. Minimum observation window: 2 weeks; longer for batch-heavy services.

ADM workspace inputs to capture:

- Observed inbound and outbound flows (with process context where supported)
- Talker / listener clusters with proposed labels
- External endpoints (likely outsourced / third-party paths)

### 5.2 ADM Analysis for MAS TRM

Review the ADM output against the technology risk register. Document, per application cluster:

| Question | MAS TRM topic |
|---|---|
| Which workloads receive connections from outside the Critical-Systems scope? | Access Control |
| Which database flows are encrypted vs. plaintext? | Data and Infrastructure Security |
| Which systems reach Outsourced-Third-Parties endpoints? | Management of IT Services |
| Are there unexpected lateral connections inside Critical-Systems? | Cyber Security Operations |
| Which workloads talk to Security-Services (identity, monitoring, patching)? | IT Resilience |

### 5.3 Classification and Re-Scoping

1. Export the ADM clusters and review with each application owner.
2. Confirm which clusters are Critical-Systems vs. supporting services.
3. Apply or correct labels (`application`, `data_class`, `criticality`) in CSW.
4. Move workloads into the correct scope.
5. Re-run ADM against the corrected scope to produce the candidate policy.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35)

### 6.1 MAS-Aligned Policy Framework

**Absolute (always-enforced) policies:**

```
DENY  Any                  → Critical-Systems           (default deny inbound)
DENY  Critical-Systems     → Internet                   (no direct internet egress from critical workloads)
DENY  Corporate-IT         → Critical-Systems           (admin paths only via approved jump points)
```

**Allowlist policies (least privilege; examples to adapt per application):**

```
ALLOW Channel-Layer        → Payments-Gateway           tcp/443
ALLOW Payments-Gateway     → Core-Banking-DB            tcp/<db-port-tls-only>
ALLOW Core-Banking         → Identity-Adjacent          tcp/636 (LDAPS), tcp/88 (Kerberos)
ALLOW Jump-Hosts           → Critical-Systems           tcp/22, tcp/3389  (admin only)
ALLOW Critical-Systems     → Monitoring-Stack           tcp/443 (telemetry egress)
```

**Catch-all (audit everything else):**

```
LOG   Any                  → Critical-Systems   (unmatched flows trigger alert)
LOG   Critical-Systems     → Any                (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Lifecycle

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2 weeks | Validate the candidate policy against live traffic; tune false positives |
| 2 | Enforcement (high-confidence rules only) | 1 week | Enforce only clear-cut policies (e.g. internet egress deny) |
| 3 | Full Enforcement | Ongoing | Workload allowlist enforced; exceptions reviewed monthly |

Treat the policy workspace itself as evidence: export the workspace snapshot at the end of each phase and at every formal change.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Topic Mapping with CSW Evidence

| MAS TRM topic | What CSW produces | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| Technology asset inventory | CSW workload inventory; scope and label export | Reconcile against the institution's CMDB / asset register |
| Information security risk assessment | Vulnerability exposure report scoped to the workload set | Provide reachability and exposure context to the risk register |
| Access control (network access layer) | Policy workspace report; enforced allowlist and exception register | Show that workload-to-workload paths require explicit approval |
| Data security | Plaintext-flow detection from observed flows | Identify unencrypted protocols on regulated paths |
| Vulnerability management | CVE / package exposure with reachability context | Prioritise patching of internet-reachable or critical-system-reachable workloads |
| Security monitoring | Flow + process telemetry, anomaly alerts, SIEM export | Demonstrate detection coverage of critical-system flows |
| Cyber security operations | Forensic flow and process search across the incident window | Rebuild a workload-level communication timeline for an investigation |
| Management of IT services / outsourcing | Outbound flow summary to third-party endpoints | Reconcile against the outsourcing register and contractual scope |
| IT audit | Periodic evidence pack (sections 10.1–10.2) | Audit work-paper input |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability & Risk Management

CSW vulnerability data is one input among threat intelligence, impact, control testing, and operational risk evidence. It should not be presented as the institution's full risk assessment.

**Prioritisation pattern (adapt to the institution's risk appetite):**

```
Priority 1: Critical CVE on Critical-Systems with inbound reachability         → patch / mitigate within agreed SLA
Priority 2: High CVE on Critical-Systems                                       → patch / mitigate within agreed SLA
Priority 3: Critical CVE on supporting workloads with reach to Critical-Systems → mitigate or restrict path
```

**Compensating controls in CSW (when patch is delayed):** restrict the vulnerable port to approved sources only, add an anomaly alert on the affected process, log all connections to the affected workload, and document the exception in the workspace exception register.

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting

### 9.1 MAS-Relevant Alerts

| Alert | Trigger | MAS TRM topic |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorised reach to Critical-Systems | Any unapproved source → Critical-Systems | Access Control |
| Plaintext protocol detected on customer-data path | HTTP / FTP / unencrypted DB protocol from Customer-Data | Data Security |
| Lateral movement inside Critical-Systems | New east-west flow that wasn't in the approved baseline | Cyber Security Operations |
| External egress from Critical-Systems | Critical-Systems → external endpoint outside the allow-list | Outsourcing / IT Services |
| Policy violation | Enforced policy block triggered | Access Control |
| Vulnerability spike | New Critical CVE on a Critical-Systems workload | Cyber Security Assessment |
| Sensor offline | Agent stops reporting | Monitoring evidence integrity |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry

For investigation, CSW retains the flow and process telemetry needed to rebuild a workload-level timeline. The investigation pack should contain:

- Flow log scoped to the affected workload(s) and time window (with process context)
- Process search output for the same window
- Policy workspace state at the time of the incident
- Vulnerability snapshot for the affected workload(s)

Retain investigation packs per the institution's retention policy and any MAS supervisory expectations.

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Audit / Supervisory Cycle (quarterly recommended)

| Evidence item | CSW source area | MAS TRM topic supported |
|---|---|---|
| Workload inventory snapshot | Inventory and scope export | Technology asset inventory |
| Scope and label membership | Scope membership export | Tech risk classification |
| Approved vs. observed flow comparison | ADM workspace export | Access Control / Data Security |
| Policy workspace snapshot | Policy workspace export | Access Control |
| Policy enforcement / violation log | Policy analysis output | Cyber Security Operations |
| Vulnerability exposure report | Vulnerability report scoped to MAS-TRM | Cyber Security Assessment |
| Third-party egress summary | Flow search filtered to outsourced endpoints | Management of IT Services |
| Incident timeline sample | Flow + process search for a representative incident | Cyber Security Operations |
| Exception register | Policy workspace exceptions list | Risk acceptance evidence |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- **Monthly:** scope / inventory review (workloads joining or leaving Critical-Systems); third-party egress review against the outsourcing register
- **Quarterly:** policy workspace review (validate rules still reflect current ADM); refresh evidence pack 10.1
- **Annually:** independent walk-through with internal audit; refresh the documented assumptions and CSW configuration baseline
- **Continuously:** policy drift detection (compare current workspace to last approved baseline); ADM re-run every 90 days

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Treating CSW evidence as the institution's risk assessment | CSW is one input; the technology risk register and risk appetite are governance artefacts |
| Critical workloads missing labels because CMDB is stale | Reconcile CMDB ↔ CSW inventory monthly; treat label hygiene as a control |
| Scope set too broad (subnet-based) instead of workload-based | Use process + label identity for scope membership, not just IP |
| ADM run too short and missing month-end / batch flows | Minimum 2-week observation; align to business cycles |
| Outsourced PaaS / SaaS treated as instrumented | Maintain a `cannot-instrument` register; document compensating controls |
| Enforcement applied before simulation | Always run Simulation first; stage enforcement scope-by-scope |
| Plaintext protocols allow-listed because of port-only rules | Identify protocols by process + observed handshake, not port number |
