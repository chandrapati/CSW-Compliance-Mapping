# Cisco Secure Workload — NIST 800-53 Rev 5 Compliance Framework
## Technical Runbook | Federal & Enterprise Accounts

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 (CSW-Relevant Control Families)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Federal agencies (civilian and DoD), FedRAMP
applicants, and enterprises that have adopted 800-53 as a security
overlay, plus the assessors supporting them.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *For my system's impact level (LOW / MODERATE / HIGH), which AC, AU,
  CM, and SC controls become continuous monitoring rather than
  periodic-assessment items?* (CA-7)
- *Can my POA&M be partially burned down through automated CSW
  evidence rather than manual remediation tracking?* (CA-5, RA-5)
- *For SC-7 boundary protection, what is my evidence at the workload
  tier — distinct from perimeter firewalls and CSPM?*
- *For SI-4 system monitoring, can I show end-to-end visibility from
  process initiation through network conversation to data store?*
- *If my assessor wants machine-readable artifacts (OSCAL-adjacent),
  what does CSW produce vs. what still requires narrative
  documentation?*

**What you'll need.** Your system's FIPS 199 categorization, a current
or draft System Security Plan (SSP), your control overlay if any
(e.g., HIGH baseline, FedRAMP Mod), and your assessor's evidence
format expectations.

**Where to start.** Section 2 walks the seven control families CSW
addresses most directly; section 3 maps coverage by impact level; go
to section 4 if you're building the evidence package now.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- AC-4 information-flow enforcement with exportable policy artefacts
- CA-7 continuous monitoring via inventory, flows, and violations
- CM-2/3/8 baseline and change tracking through ADM drift

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

## 1. Overview

NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems. CSW can support technical evidence for selected controls across seven key families: **AC** (Access Control), **AU** (Audit & Accountability), **CM** (Configuration Management), **IR** (Incident Response), **RA** (Risk Assessment), **SC** (System & Communications Protection), and **SI** (System & Information Integrity).

---

## 2. Control Family Mapping

### AC — Access Control

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| AC-3 | Access Enforcement | Micro-segmentation enforces allowlist policies at workload level |
| AC-4 | Information Flow Enforcement | ADM maps observed flows within CSW coverage; policy blocks unauthorized paths where enforcement is deployed |
| AC-6 | Least Privilege | Workload-scoped policies grant minimum required network access |
| AC-17 | Remote Access | Jump-host enforcement; remote admin paths explicitly defined and logged |
| AC-20 | Use of External Systems | External partner scope with restricted, audited access paths |

**CSW Implementation:**
```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Policy type: Allowlist (default deny)
  → Scope: target workload group
  → Document each allowed flow with business justification
  → Export policy for AC-3/AC-4 control evidence
```

### AU — Audit & Accountability

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| AU-2 | Event Logging | Full network flow + process telemetry on all monitored workloads |
| AU-3 | Content of Audit Records | 5-tuple flows + process name + user context + timestamp |
| AU-6 | Audit Record Review | Alerts export to SIEM for automated review; anomaly detection |
| AU-9 | Protection of Audit Information | CSW telemetry stored in tamper-resistant cluster |
| AU-12 | Audit Record Generation | Continuous logging; configurable retention (recommend 3 years for federal) |

**Log Content per AU-3:**
- Source/destination IP and port
- Protocol and direction
- Process name and hash
- Parent process context
- User context (where OS supports)
- Policy action (allow/deny/alert)
- Timestamp (UTC, microsecond precision)

### CM — Configuration Management

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| CM-2 | Baseline Configuration | ADM establishes approved communication baseline |
| CM-6 | Configuration Settings | Process monitoring detects configuration drift (new processes, new ports) |
| CM-7 | Least Functionality | Block non-approved services via port-level policy enforcement |
| CM-8 | System Component Inventory | CSW inventory provides a workload asset catalog for covered components; reconcile with the SSP / CMDB for full CM-8 scope |

**Baseline Drift Detection:**
```
CSW UI → Investigate → ADM
  → Re-run ADM quarterly
  → Compare to previous baseline
  → New flows = configuration change review required
  → Policy workspace updated to reflect approved changes
```

### IR — Incident Response

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| IR-4 | Incident Handling | Forensic telemetry enables full incident reconstruction |
| IR-5 | Incident Monitoring | Real-time anomaly alerts; policy violation events |
| IR-6 | Incident Reporting | Alert export to SIEM/SOAR for automated incident ticket creation |
| IR-10 | Integrated Information Security Analysis | CSW correlates network + process + vulnerability context per incident |

**Forensic Investigation Workflow:**
```
1. Alert triggered → CSW alert with workload ID, time, flow context
2. Flow Search → reconstruct all connections from/to affected workload
3. Process Search → identify anomalous processes + parent chain
4. Vulnerability Report → identify exploited CVE if applicable
5. Export → full forensic package for IR team
```

### RA — Risk Assessment

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| RA-3 | Risk Assessment | Vulnerability data + ADM attack surface = continuous risk posture |
| RA-5 | Vulnerability Monitoring | Continuous vulnerability exposure visibility with CVSS scoring |
| RA-7 | Risk Response | Compensating controls via policy when patching delayed |
| RA-9 | Criticality Analysis | Scope-based tagging identifies high-criticality workloads |

### SC — System & Communications Protection

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| SC-7 | Boundary Protection | Micro-segmentation enforces east-west boundaries |
| SC-8 | Transmission Confidentiality | Detect and block unencrypted sensitive data flows |
| SC-28 | Protection of Information at Rest | Identify workloads with unencrypted storage access paths |
| SC-39 | Process Isolation | Workload-level policy ensures process-to-process isolation |

### SI — System & Information Integrity

| Control | Name | CSW Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| SI-2 | Flaw Remediation | Continuous vulnerability exposure view; prioritized remediation guidance |
| SI-3 | Malicious Code Protection | Process hash monitoring provides detection signals that complement AV / EDR controls |
| SI-4 | System Monitoring | Full telemetry with anomaly detection and alerting |
| SI-7 | Software & Firmware Integrity | Process hash baseline from ADM; deviation triggers alert |

---

## 3. NIST Impact Level Guidance

| Impact Level | CSW Configuration |
|---|---|
| Low | ADM + monitoring only; simulation policies |
| Moderate | ADM + enforcement on sensitive scopes; full alerting |
| High | ADM + full enforcement; process-level monitoring; 3-year telemetry retention |

---

## 4. Evidence Package

| Evidence Item | CSW Source | Control Family | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy enforcement log | Defend → Policy Workspaces | AC | Per audit |
| Network flow audit log | Investigate → Flow Search | AU | Continuous |
| Vulnerability report | Investigate → Vulnerability | RA, SI | Weekly |
| ADM baseline map | Investigate → ADM | CM | Quarterly |
| Alert/incident log | Alerts → Dashboard | IR | Monthly |
| Workload inventory | Manage → Inventory | CM | Monthly |
| Process anomaly report | Investigate → Process Search | SI | On-demand |
