# Cisco Secure Workload — NIST SP 800-207A
## Technical Runbook | PDP/PEP/PA/PIP Implementation Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Standard:** NIST SP 800-207A (Public Draft) — ZTA Model for Access Control in Cloud-Native & Multi-Cloud Environments  
**Audience:** Solutions Architects, Security Engineers, GRC Practitioners  
**Environment:** Hybrid (On-Premises + AWS / Azure / GCP)

> ⚠ **Draft Notice:** NIST SP 800-207A is in public draft / comment stage. This runbook is anchored to the stable PDP/PEP/PA/PIP logical component model, which is consistent with SP 800-207 and unlikely to change materially. Sections derived from draft-specific content are marked **[DRAFT REF]**. Verify against the final published standard before use in formal audit submissions.

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Enterprises extending zero-trust principles
across satellite locations, multi-cloud environments, and partner
boundaries; security architects who already have an 800-207 baseline
and need to operationalize it; and Cisco SAs supporting them.

> If you haven't read the [800-207 runbook](../NIST-800-207/CSW-NIST-800-207-Technical-Runbook.md)
> yet, start there. 800-207A assumes you understand the seven tenets
> and is concerned with *how the components actually wire together*.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Where in my stack do the Policy Decision Point (PDP), Policy
  Enforcement Point (PEP), Policy Administrator (PA), and Policy
  Information Point (PIP) physically live today? Are any of these
  roles unimplemented or implicit?*
- *Can I trace a single access transaction end-to-end through these
  four components and produce a timeline of what each one decided?*
- *In a multi-cloud environment, do I have a single PDP that brokers
  decisions across clouds, or one PDP per cloud? What are the
  trade-offs for my use cases?*
- *What evidence proves that my PEP is actually enforcing what the
  PDP decided, rather than silently failing open or stale?*
- *For my use case (satellite office, multi-cloud, cross-enterprise
  collaboration), which 800-207A reference architecture is closest
  and where does CSW fit?*

**What you'll need.** Solid familiarity with NIST SP 800-207, an
inventory of your cloud environments and their identity boundaries,
your current policy decision and enforcement tooling map (CSPM,
SASE, EDR, identity), and a sense of which use cases (sections 7.1 –
7.3) match your environment.

**Where to start.** Section 1 if you need the 800-207A vs. 800-207
delta first; sections 2–5 walk PDP, PEP, PA, PIP one at a time;
section 6 demonstrates an end-to-end access transaction trace; section
7 maps your use case to a reference architecture; section 9 if
you're packaging evidence.

## 1. Overview — 800-207A vs. 800-207

| | SP 800-207 | SP 800-207A |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Seven ZTA tenets + logical architecture | PDP/PEP/PA/PIP component model + access transaction flow |
| **Output** | "Does our architecture satisfy ZTA?" | "How do we implement ZTA components operationally?" |
| **Primary audience** | CISOs, architects | GRC, security engineers, cloud architects |
| **CSW mapping** | Tenet-by-tenet (see companion doc) | Component-by-component (this document) |

**CSW in the 800-207A model:**
- **PEP** → CSW software sensor (enforcement at workload level)
- **PDP** → CSW policy engine (per-flow access decision)
- **PA** → CSW policy workspace (policy authoring, deployment, audit)
- **PIP** → CSW telemetry (vulnerability, process, ADM baseline, flow context)

---

## 2. PDP — Policy Decision Point

### What 800-207A Requires
The PDP evaluates every access request and issues a decision: allow, deny, or redirect. It must:
- Consume posture signals from the PIP continuously
- Apply policy authored by the PA
- Re-evaluate on every access transaction — not just session establishment
- Log every decision for audit

### CSW Implementation

**Policy Engine Configuration:**
```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Policy Workspace: [Your-ZTA-Workspace]
  → Mode: Enforcement (after simulation validation)
  → Priority: Absolute Policies first, then ranked allowlist

Absolute Policies (PDP hard denials — never overridden):
  DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope         # Default deny inbound
  DENY: Sensitive-Scope → Internet    # No direct internet egress
  DENY: Any → Sensitive-Scope (port 80, 21, 23, 389)  # Non-compliant protocols

Allowlist Policies (PDP conditional allows):
  ALLOW: [Source Workload] → [Dest Workload] (port X)
  → Derived from ADM output — actual observed traffic
  → Each rule = one approved access transaction pattern
```

**Vulnerability-Aware PDP (Posture-Informed Decisions):**
```
Workflow: CSW vulnerability alert → compensating policy → PDP behavior change

Step 1: CSW detects Critical CVE on Workload Y
Step 2: Alert fires → SOAR playbook triggered
Step 3: SOAR calls CSW API:
  POST /openapi/v1/policies
  {
    "workspace": "ZTA-Enforcement",
    "name":      "vuln-restrict-WorkloadY",
    "priority":  "ABSOLUTE",
    "action":    "DENY",
    "src":       "ANY",
    "dst":       "WorkloadY",
    "comment":   "Compensating control — CVE-XXXX-YYYY unpatched"
  }
Step 4: PDP now denies all access to Workload Y except admin jump-host
Step 5: On patch completion → SOAR removes compensating policy
```

**PDP Decision Audit:**
```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → All flows: ALLOW decisions (connection established)
  → Filter: "Denied" → DENY decisions (policy violation)
  → Export: Full decision log with timestamp, source, dest, rule matched
  → Retention: Configure minimum 12 months for ZTA audit
```

---

## 3. PEP — Policy Enforcement Point

### What 800-207A Requires
The PEP must:
- Sit inline between subject and resource — not at perimeter only
- Act on PDP decisions in real time
- Monitor active connections throughout their lifetime
- Be able to terminate connections when policy changes mid-session
- Operate consistently across all environments (on-prem and cloud)

### CSW Implementation

**Sensor Deployment (PEP installation):**
```bash
# Linux — RHEL/CentOS
rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm
systemctl enable tetd && systemctl start tetd

# Linux — Ubuntu/Debian
dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb
systemctl enable tetd && systemctl start tetd

# Windows
msiexec /i TetSensor.msi /quiet

# Verify PEP is active:
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Status: Active (green)
  → Policy sync: Current
  → Last heartbeat: < 60 seconds ago
```

**PEP Enforcement Modes:**
| Mode | Behavior | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Monitoring | Observe only — log flows, no enforcement | Initial ADM phase |
| Simulation | Test policy decisions — log would-block events | Pre-enforcement validation |
| Enforcement | Full PEP — allow/deny per policy | Production ZTA state |

**PEP Progression (mandatory — do not skip simulation):**
```
Week 1–4:   Monitoring mode → ADM collects baseline
Week 5–6:   Simulation mode → Validate no false positives
            CSW UI → Defend → Workspace → View Simulation Results
            → Review all "would-deny" events
            → Work with app owners to resolve legitimate flows
Week 7+:    Enforcement mode → Full PEP active
```

**Connection Termination (mid-session policy change):**
```
Scenario: SOAR isolates workload during active incident

Step 1: Analyst triggers isolation in SOAR
Step 2: SOAR calls CSW API → pushes DENY ALL policy for WorkloadZ
Step 3: CSW PEP on WorkloadZ:
  → Drops all new inbound connections immediately
  → Terminates existing connections within policy sync interval
  → Logs termination event with timestamp and triggering policy

Evidence: Connection termination log → CSW UI → Alerts → Policy Enforcement
```

**Agentless PEP (cloud workloads without sensor):**
```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → AWS: Cloud connector → VPC Flow Log ingestion
          + CSW pushes rules to Security Groups via API
  → Azure: Cloud connector → NSG Flow Log ingestion
           + CSW pushes rules to NSGs via API
  → GCP: Cloud connector → VPC Flow Log ingestion

Note: Agentless = visibility + cloud-native enforcement
      Agent-based = full inline workload-level PEP enforcement
      Agent preferred for NIST 800-207A compliance
```

## 4. PA — Policy Administrator

### What 800-207A Requires
The PA must:
- Author policy based on PDP decisions and operator intent
- Deploy policy to PEPs in a controlled, auditable manner
- Maintain complete version history of all policy changes
- Support dynamic policy updates (automated and manual)
- Provide rollback capability

### CSW Implementation

**Policy Workspace as PA:**
```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Create Workspace: "800-207A-ZTA-Policy"
  → Scope: [Target scope — start broad, narrow with ADM]
  → Import ADM: Pull discovered flows as proposed policy baseline
  → Review: Approve/reject each proposed rule
  → Simulate: Run simulation before enforcement
  → Enforce: Promote to enforcement after validation
```

**PA Change Management Process:**
```
1. PROPOSE:   Engineer drafts new policy rule in workspace (Draft state)
2. REVIEW:    Security lead reviews — adds comment/approval in workspace
3. SIMULATE:  Run simulation — validate no legitimate traffic blocked
4. APPROVE:   CISO/security owner approves enforcement
5. ENFORCE:   Promote workspace to Enforcement mode
6. AUDIT:     Change recorded in workspace version history:
              → Who made the change (operator ID)
              → What changed (rule added/modified/deleted)
              → When (timestamp)
              → Simulation results (pass/fail)
```

**API-Driven PA (Dynamic Policy Automation):**
```bash
# CSW REST API base
BASE_URL="https://<csw-cluster>/openapi/v1"
API_KEY="<your-api-key>"   # Manage → API Keys

# Create a new policy rule (PA function via API)
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/policies" \
  -H "X-Tetration-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace_id": "<workspace-id>",
    "policy_name": "allow-svc-a-to-svc-b",
    "action": "ALLOW",
    "src_filter": {"name": "Service-A-Scope"},
    "dst_filter": {"name": "Service-B-Scope"},
    "l4_params": [{"port": [443, 443], "proto": 6}]
  }'

# Delete a policy rule (PA revocation via API)
curl -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/policies/<policy-id>" \
  -H "X-Tetration-API-Key: $API_KEY"
```

**PA Rollback:**
```
CSW UI → Defend → Workspace → Version History
  → Select prior version
  → Compare: Current vs. Prior (diff view)
  → Rollback: Restore prior version
  → Rollback is itself logged as a versioned change
```

## 5. PIP — Policy Information Point

### What 800-207A Requires
The PIP must provide continuous, real-time attribute signals to the PDP across three domains:
1. **Subject attributes** — who/what is requesting access
2. **Resource/device posture** — health state of the requesting and target entities
3. **Environmental context** — current threat conditions, network state, anomalies

### CSW Implementation

**Workload Posture PIP (Device/Resource Domain):**
```
CSW Vulnerability Feed:
  → Continuous CVE scanning — no scheduling required
  → Per-workload CVE inventory with CVSS score
  → SIEM export: Kafka/Syslog → real-time posture feed
  → API query: GET /openapi/v1/vulnerabilities?workload=<id>

Process Integrity PIP:
  → CSW monitors all running processes per workload
  → Process hash database: approved vs. unknown
  → Alert: New process not in ADM baseline
  → Alert: Process hash change (binary modified)
  CSW UI → Alerts → Process Anomaly → Enable all triggers
```

**Environmental Context PIP (Network Domain):**
```
ADM Baseline as Environmental PIP:
  → ADM establishes "normal" environment baseline
  → Any deviation = environmental anomaly signal
  → New flow not in ADM → alert → PDP can tighten access
  → New external IP contacting internal workload → alert

Configure environmental alerts:
  CSW UI → Alerts → Create Alert
    Trigger: New flow not matching ADM baseline
    Scope: All sensitive scopes
    Severity: High
    Action: SIEM + email + Webex notification
```

**Subject/NPE Identity PIP:**
```
Non-Person Entity (NPE) identification per access request:
  CSW captures per flow:
    - Source workload identity (hostname, labels, scope)
    - Initiating process name and hash
    - Parent process (process tree context)
    - User context (if OS-level user tracking enabled)

  API query for NPE identity context:
    GET /openapi/v1/flowsearch
    Filter: dst=<resource-workload>, time=<window>
    Returns: src_workload, process_name, process_hash, user
```

**Aggregated PIP — SIEM Integration:**
```
CSW UI → Platform → Data Export
  → Kafka (recommended for real-time):
      Topic: csw-flows, csw-alerts, csw-vulnerabilities
      Consumer: SIEM Kafka connector
  → Syslog:
      Protocol: TCP (reliable delivery)
      Format: CEF or JSON
      Destination: SIEM syslog receiver

SIEM receives from CSW PIP:
  → All flow events (subject + resource identity)
  → Vulnerability state changes (posture PIP)
  → Process anomaly alerts (integrity PIP)
  → Policy violation events (enforcement PIP)
  → ADM baseline deviations (environmental PIP)

Cross-correlate in SIEM with:
  → Identity PIP: IdP login events (Okta, Azure AD)
  → Endpoint PIP: EDR alerts (Cisco XDR, CrowdStrike)
  → Threat Intel PIP: Cisco Talos IOC feeds
```

## 6. 800-207A Access Transaction — Step-by-Step Trace

**[DRAFT REF] — Access transaction model from 800-207A public draft**

Scenario: Service A (client workload) → Service B (API server) on port 443

```
T=0ms   Service A process initiates TCP SYN to Service B:443

T=1ms   CSW PEP (sensor on Service B) intercepts SYN packet
        → Captures: src_ip, src_workload_id, dst_port=443, proto=TCP

T=2ms   PEP queries local PDP (distributed policy engine on sensor):
        Input attributes:
          src_scope:    "App-Tier"
          dst_scope:    "Data-Tier"
          dst_port:     443
          protocol:     TCP
          src_vuln:     CVSS_max=4.2 (no critical CVEs)
          src_process:  "java" hash=<approved>
          flow_in_ADM:  YES (approved flow)

T=3ms   PDP evaluates against active policy workspace:
        Rule match: ALLOW App-Tier → Data-Tier (443/TCP) ✓
        Decision:   ALLOW
        Decision ID: <uuid> logged to telemetry

T=4ms   PEP allows TCP SYN to complete → handshake proceeds
        Session logged: src, dst, process, user, decision_id, timestamp

T=ongoing  CSW monitors session: bytes, duration, behavioral deviation
           → Any anomaly mid-session → alert → SOAR can trigger isolation

T=end   Session terminates (FIN/RST)
        Full session record: start, end, bytes_in, bytes_out, process, decision
        → Exported to SIEM for ZTA audit trail
```

## 7. Use Case Implementation Guides

### Use Case 1 — Enterprise with Satellite Facilities **[DRAFT REF]**

```
Scope Architecture:
  HQ-Sensitive     → Default-deny inbound from Branch scopes
  HQ-Shared        → Allowlist: approved Branch-to-HQ flows only
  Branch-[Site]    → Default-deny inbound from other Branch scopes
  Management       → Jump-host only access to all sensitive scopes

Key policies:
  DENY: Branch-* → HQ-Sensitive (default)
  ALLOW: Branch-A → HQ-Shared (specific approved ports)
  DENY: Branch-A → Branch-B (no lateral branch-to-branch)
  LOG: All cross-facility flows (full audit trail)
```

### Use Case 2 — Multi-Cloud Enterprise **[DRAFT REF]**

```
Cloud connector setup per provider:
  AWS:   IAM Role → VPC Flow Logs + tag sync
  Azure: Service Principal → NSG Flow Logs + resource group sync  
  GCP:   Service Account → VPC Flow Logs + label sync

Unified scope across clouds:
  Cloud-PHI-Zone     (spans AWS + Azure + on-prem PHI workloads)
  Cloud-App-Tier     (spans GCP + Azure app workloads)
  Cloud-Data-Tier    (spans AWS RDS + on-prem databases)

Policy: Same allowlist workspace governs ALL cloud workloads
        No per-cloud policy fragmentation
        ADM discovers cross-cloud dependencies automatically
```

### Use Case 3 — Collaboration Across Enterprise Boundaries **[DRAFT REF]**

```
Partner access model:
  Scope: External-Partners-[PartnerName]
  
  Onboarding workflow:
    Step 1: Document approved access in BAA/contract
    Step 2: Create partner-specific scope in CSW
    Step 3: Add partner IP ranges / workload labels to scope
    Step 4: Create allowlist: Partner-Scope → Approved-Resource (port X only)
    Step 5: Enable full flow logging for partner scope
    Step 6: Quarterly review: re-validate partner flows vs. contract scope

  Revocation (instant):
    CSW API → DELETE partner allowlist rules
    → Partner access removed within policy sync interval
    → No network reconfiguration required
    → Revocation logged in workspace version history
```
