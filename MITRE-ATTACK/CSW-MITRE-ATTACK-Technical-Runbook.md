# Cisco Secure Workload — MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise) Mapping
## Technical Runbook | Threat Detection & Containment Evidence

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)  
**ATT&CK Reference:** MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise (matrices, tactics, techniques)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Security operations, detection engineering, and purple teams building coverage narratives against the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise matrix; architects proving workload-tier detection and containment for assessments, tabletop exercises, or customer security reviews.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *For each top-level tactic (Initial Access through Impact), what does CSW observe or enforce at the workload and flow layer, and what evidence can I export?*
- *Which techniques have a defensible mapping to CSW telemetry (flows, processes, inventory) versus those that require endpoint-heavy or identity-centric tooling?*
- *How do I baseline “normal” east-west and north-south behavior so tactic-aligned anomalies (new ports, scanning, beacons, staging) are actionable?*
- *What do I pair with CSW so coverage gaps against ATT&CK do not leave blind spots?* (Cisco XDR, EDR, email security, SIEM/SOAR)

**What you'll need.** A current workload inventory, ATT&CK Navigator or internal coverage spreadsheet (optional), scope for crown-jewel applications, and integration targets for alerts (SIEM, ticketing, Cisco XDR).

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 for executive coverage narrative; 3–7 to deploy and baseline; 8–9 for tactic and technique mapping tables; 10–12 for boundaries, evidence exports, and pitfalls.

## 1. Overview

MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques, not a compliance checklist. This runbook shows how **Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)** contributes **detection signals**, **prevention where microsegmentation is enforced**, and **evidence artifacts** aligned to Enterprise tactics. CSW excels at **workload-native visibility**: process context, connection graphs, and policy actions on allowed/denied traffic.

**Important distinction:** CSW is **not** a full EDR/XDR replacement. It provides strong **network-behavior** and **workload-process** telemetry layered with **segmentation**. For comprehensive ATT&CK coverage, pair CSW with **Cisco XDR** (or another XDR), **managed EDR**, identity threat detection, email security, and a **SIEM** for correlation and retention policies that match your program.

### ATT&CK Tactics and CSW Capability Summary

| Tactic ID | Tactic | Primary CSW Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| TA0001 | Initial Access | Flow anomaly detection; new inbound connections to **previously unseen ports** on protected workloads; policy blocks on unapproved ingress paths |
| TA0002 | Execution | Forensics / process monitoring: **unseen commands**, script interpreters spawning unexpected children, **DLL side-loading** patterns (process + image path context) |
| TA0003 | Persistence | New listening services; **package/process change** detection; new or modified system services aligned to inventory drift |
| TA0004 | Privilege Escalation | Process **privilege context** monitoring where sensors provide it; anomalous escalation tooling spawning from low-trust parents |
| TA0005 | Defense Evasion | **Baseline drift**: new outbound paths; rare processes; unexpected tunnel or proxy behavior visible at flow + process layer |
| TA0006 | Credential Access | Detection of **credential-harvesting tool patterns** (process name, hash, lineage); suspicious access to security account manager paths (sensor-dependent) |
| TA0007 | Discovery | **Network scanning** behavior inferred from flow fan-out, failed connections, and sweep patterns on internal segments |
| TA0008 | Lateral Movement | **Microsegmentation** blocks; east-west **flow telemetry**; explicit allowlists for admin protocols (RDP, SSH, SMB, WinRM) |
| TA0009 | Collection | **Egress monitoring** for staging (bulk internal copy, new internal sinks, unusual cross-zone flows) |
| TA0010 | Exfiltration | **Egress flow anomalies**; unusual external destinations; volume/duration outliers |
| TA0011 | Command and Control | **C2 beaconing** candidates from periodic flow patterns (interval, jitter-aware review in SIEM), new external long-lived sessions |
| TA0040 | Impact | Process anomalies associated with **encryption/ransomware-style** behavior (mass file-touch patterns visible indirectly via process + egress); containment via policy |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW sensors for ATT&CK-aligned use cases, confirm:

- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-premises) is provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Outbound connectivity from workloads to the cluster (typically TCP 443)
- [ ] Linux/Windows sensor compatibility verified for **crown-jewel** and **Tier-0** adjacent systems first
- [ ] Cloud connectors configured (AWS, Azure, GCP) where agentless flow visibility is required
- [ ] **SIEM or XDR** destination for alerts identified (normalize tactic tags in event forwarding)
- [ ] Stakeholders aligned: SOC Lead, Detection Engineering, Infrastructure Owner
- [ ] Change window approved: start in **monitoring-only** enforcement on production

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 On-Premises Workloads

**Install software sensors:**

```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS)
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb

# Verify service
systemctl status csw-agent
```

**Windows:** deploy via your standard package pipeline (MSI); confirm the agent reports **Active** in the CSW console.

### 3.2 Cloud Workloads

**VM-based:** same sensor installs as on-premises.

**Agentless visibility (connectors):**

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Add AWS / Azure / GCP connector
  → Grant least-privilege IAM/SPN for inventory + flow ingestion (e.g., VPC Flow Logs)
```

### 3.3 Initial Posture

- Enforcement: **Monitoring only** until baselines exist.
- Enable **process hash**, **flow**, and **vulnerability/reachability** features supported in your SKU.
- Tags: apply `criticality:crown-jewel`, `mitre:protected`, `env:production` consistently.

**Validation:**

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Status: Active for all in-scope hosts
  → Confirm flow and process tiles populated for sample workloads
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope Design (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Recommended Scope Hierarchy for ATT&CK Use Cases

Organize scopes to match **lateral movement choke points** and **high-value data stores**.

```
Root: Enterprise-ATTCK
├── Tier0-Identity-Adjacent      # AD, PKI, MFA brokers (if instrumented)
├── Crown-Jewel-Apps            # ERP, data warehouse, pipeline controllers
├── Server-Farm-General
├── Jump-Host-Enclave
├── DevTest-Isolated
└── Internet-Facing-Entry       # ingress inspection + strict outbound
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters for “First Defenders”

```
Filter: Internet-Facing-Listeners
  - Scope: Internet-Facing-Entry + cloud public subnets
  - Listening ports: any (review against change tickets)

Filter: Sensitive-Data-Stores
  - Process: mysqld, postgres, oracle, mongo*, sqlservr, etc.
  - Tags: data-classification = restricted / secret
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label | Example | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `criticality` | crown-jewel, standard | Prioritize detections and baselines |
| `attack-surface` | internet-facing, internal-only | Ingress anomaly policies |
| `data-class` | restricted, public | Exfiltration monitoring scope |
| `owner-team` | app-owners, platform | Incident routing |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility & Baseline (Days 11–21)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)

ADM establishes **normal** conversations—required to separate benign admin traffic from lateral movement.

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → New Workspace: "ATTACK-Baseline-<YYYY-Qx>"
  → Scope: Crown-Jewel-Apps + Tier0-Identity-Adjacent (expand as needed)
  → Window: minimum 2–4 weeks (cover patch Tuesday and month-end jobs)
  → Enable process context on sensors that support it
```

### 5.2 Baseline Review Questions (Tactic-Oriented)

| Review focus | ATT&CK relevance |
|---|---|
| First-time inbound ports on internet-facing tiers | TA0001 |
| Rare outbound destinations from Tier-0 adjacent subnets | TA0011, TA0010 |
| East-west fan-out (many internal targets in short window) | TA0007, TA0008 |
| Long-lived low-and-slow sessions to new external IPs | TA0011 |
| New services or listeners without change correlation | TA0003 |

### 5.3 Export Baseline Snapshot

Periodically export ADM graph or policy-import baseline for **drift comparison** during purple-team or assessor walkthroughs.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design (Days 22–35)

Design policies that **reduce blast radius** (tactics TA0008, TA0010, TA0011) while **logging** novel paths for detection (TA0001, TA0007).

### 6.1 Illustrative Segmentation Policy Snippets

**Default posture for crown-jewel tier (conceptual — adapt to your workspace syntax):**

```
# Deny lateral paths not observed in ADM (after simulation)
DENY: Server-Farm-General → Crown-Jewel-Apps (default)
ALLOW: Jump-Host-Enclave → Crown-Jewel-Apps (tcp/22, tcp/3389, tcp/443 as approved)
ALLOW: Crown-Jewel-Apps → Approved-Patch-Mirrors (tcp/443)

# Contain internet-facing tier: no direct egress except proxies
DENY: Internet-Facing-Entry → Internet (except via Egress-Proxy scope)

# Log everything unmatched for SOC review
LOG: Any → Any (unmatched)
```

**Operational note:** translate the above into your CSW **Defend → Segmentation** workspace rules; run **Simulation** until change tickets align with observed noise.

### 6.2 Jump-Host and Break-Glass

- Model **explicit** allowed admin paths (TA0008 overlap with legitimate ops).
- Use a separate **alert-only** workspace for emergency access nets if required; document in runbooks.

### 6.3 Simulation Before Enforcement

| Stage | Mode | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | Tune alerts; validate ADM completeness |
| 2 | Selective enforcement | Block highest-risk sprawl (open east-west) |
| 3 | Full enforcement (scoped) | Containment for defined tiers |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Enforcement & Detection Operations

### 7.1 Mapping Defense Modes to ATT&CK Outcomes

| CSW mode | ATT&CK outcomes |
|---|---|
| Segmentation **enforcement** | Blocks lateral movement (TA0008), some C2/exfil paths (TA0011, TA0010) when destinations are disallowed |
| Segmentation **monitor + alert** | Detects initial access surprises (TA0001), scanning (TA0007), staging (TA0009) |
| Process / flow **analytics** | Supports execution, persistence, credential, and impact stories (TA0002–TA0006, TA0040) |

### 7.2 Alert Forwarding (SIEM / XDR)

```bash
# Example: document webhook/API integration from CSW to your SIEM
# (Exact CLI varies by release — capture in your Confluence runbook)
# curl -X POST "$SIEM_HEC_URL/services/collector/event" \
#   -H "Authorization: Splunk $HEC_TOKEN" \
#   -d '{"event": "<CSW alert JSON>"}'
```

Tag forwarded events with **ATT&CK tactic/technique** IDs your SOC standardizes (e.g., `mitre_attack_tactic: lateral-movement`).

### 7.3 Purple-Team Feedback Loop

- After each exercise, attach **CSW exports** (flows, process timelines, policy hits) to the technique row in Navigator or your coverage sheet.

### 7.4 ATT&CK-Aligned Alerts (Examples)

Configure or derive alerts so SOC triage can tag **tactic ID** consistently. Exact rule names depend on your CSW release and entitlements; map these examples to your deployed behaviors.

| Alert theme | ATT&CK tactics | Typical CSW signal |
|---|---|---|
| First-seen inbound port on internet-facing tier | TA0001 | New listener + new external source talking to production scope |
| Rare process or unseen command line on protected host | TA0002 | Process forensics deviation from ADM baseline |
| New Windows service binary or unexpected `systemd` unit | TA0003 | Service / listener creation with new hash |
| Child of high-integrity parent spawning tooling from user-writable path | TA0004 | Privilege / lineage anomaly (validate with EDR) |
| Sudden binary or egress path not in last-90-day ADM | TA0005 | Drift: flow + process combined |
| Known credential-dump tool name or suspicious parent→child | TA0006 | Process catalog + lineage |
| Internal connect fan-out / failed connect storm | TA0007 | Aggregated flow metrics (finalize thresholds in SIEM) |
| East-west admin protocol from non-jump scope | TA0008 | RDP/SMB/SSH/WinRM to sensitive tier without allow rule |
| Large cross-zone fan-in to staging host | TA0009 | Volume or novelty of internal flows |
| First connection to rare external AS or geo for scope | TA0010 | Egress novelty + duration |
| Low-volume periodic HTTPS/DNS to young domain | TA0011 | Flow timing features (confirm in SIEM) |
| Many encrypted file extensions touched + mass SMB | TA0040 | Process + lateral burst (correlate with EDR file events) |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Audit & Assessment Evidence

Maintain artifacts that demonstrate **what was monitored**, **what was blocked**, and **how detections were tuned** over time.

| Evidence | CSW source | Typical consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Scope & inventory export | Manage → Inventory / Scopes | Risk team, assessors |
| ADM baseline vs current | Investigate → ADM | Change / architecture review |
| Policy workspace export | Defend → Segmentation | Segmentation attestation |
| Alert history with flow context | Alerts + Flow Search | SOC metrics, breach investigation |
| Simulation → enforcement approval | Change tickets + policy version | Governance |

---

## 9. Control Mapping: ATT&CK → CSW → Evidence

### 9.1 Tactic-Level Mapping

| ATT&CK tactic | Representative techniques (examples) | CSW capability | Evidence produced |
|---|---|---|---|
| TA0001 Initial Access | T1190, T1133, T1566* | Inbound **flow anomaly** (new service port, rare source); policy deny logs | Flow exports; policy hit timeline; ADM delta |
| TA0002 Execution | T1059, T1204, T1047 | **Process monitoring**: unseen CLI, scripting engines with rare parents | Process tree exports; hash lineage |
| TA0003 Persistence | T1543, T1547, T1574 | **New services/listeners**; package drift; side-loading indicators | Inventory diff; listener reports |
| TA0004 Privilege Escalation | T1068, T1055 | **Privilege context** + anomalous child processes | Process + user context export |
| TA0005 Defense Evasion | T1027, T1562, T1070 | **Baseline drift**; new egress; rare binaries | Drift report; flow compare |
| TA0006 Credential Access | T1003, T1558, T1110** | **Credential-tool** process patterns; suspicious SAM/LSASS adjacency (platform-dependent) | Process alerts; flow to DC |
| TA0007 Discovery | T1046, T1018, T1087** | **Scanning behavior** (failed connect fan-out); internal sweep patterns | Internal flow aggregation |
| TA0008 Lateral Movement | T1021, T1550 | **Microsegmentation**; east-west allowlist; denied RDP/SMB/SSH/WinRM | Deny logs; allowed-path attest |
| TA0009 Collection | T1005, T1119 | **Egress/internal bulk** staging patterns | Cross-scope flow report |
| TA0010 Exfiltration | T1048, T1020 | **Egress anomaly**; novel external destinations | External flow timelines |
| TA0011 Command and Control | T1071, T1095, T1573 | **Beaconing candidates** (best finalized in SIEM); long-lived odd sessions | Flow time series export |
| TA0040 Impact | T1486, T1490 | **Process anomaly**; encryption-tool patterns; mass connectivity change | Process + policy containment proof |

\*Phishing (T1566) is primarily **email/identity** telemetry—CSW supports **post-landing** workload evidence only.  
\*\*Techniques with heavy **identity** or **directory query** detail require **IdP, AD, EDR, and authentication logs**; CSW contributes supporting network and process context.

### 9.2 Technique-Level Alignment (Selected)

Use this table as a **starter mapping**—extend with your forensic rule catalog and SIEM correlations.

| Technique ID | Name | CSW alignment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1190 | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Strong (flows to new internal victims from ingress tier) | Pair with WAF/IPS for exploit payload detail |
| T1059.001 | PowerShell | Medium–strong | Unseen command lines; parent/child anomalies |
| T1059.003 | Windows Command Shell | Medium–strong | Rare cmd.exe children, encoded patterns (finalize in SIEM) |
| T1574.002 | DLL Side-Loading | Medium | Image load path + process context where available |
| T1543.003 | Windows Service | Medium | New service binary paths; new listeners |
| T1003.001 | LSASS Memory | Medium (process-centric) | Confirm with EDR/kernel telemetry |
| T1046 | Network Service Scanning | Strong (flow fan-out) | Tune thresholds per subnet |
| T1021.001 | Remote Desktop Protocol | Strong (east-west) | Default deny + allowlisted jump paths |
| T1021.002 | SMB/Windows Admin Shares | Strong | Same as above |
| T1021.004 | SSH | Strong | Pair with SSH certificate/auth logs |
| T1048 | Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol | Medium–strong | Unusual outbound proto/port combos |
| T1071.001 | Web Protocols | Medium | Beaconing analysis in SIEM |
| T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact | Medium | Process + mass egress suppression; not full file-level integrity |

## 10. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover

- **Full ATT&CK matrix coverage:** Many techniques are **identity**, **email**, **human**, or **kernel** events outside workload network/process telemetry.
- **EDR-class containment:** CSW does not replace EDR isolation APIs for all endpoint scenarios; use **Cisco XDR** or EDR for host quarantine where required.
- **Log tamper analysis on endpoints:** AU-centric questions may still require OS-level audit subsystems.
- **Cloud control plane attacks** (e.g., IAM abuse without VM traffic): complement with **CSPM/CWPP** and cloud audit logs.
- **Attribution and intent:** CSW provides **technical behaviors**; threat intelligence and hunting hypotheses live in SIEM/SOAR workflows.

---

## 11. Audit Preparation & Evidence Export

### 11.1 Standard Operating Procedure (Flow-Centric Incident)

```text
1. CSW UI → Alerts → open event → note workload, time, policy action
2. Investigate → Flow Search → pivot source/destination + port + window
3. Investigate → Process Search → capture parent chain and hashes
4. Export: CSV/JSON per your retention standard; attach tactic/technique tags
5. Archive: store with ticket ID; map to purple-team or RCA document
```

### 11.2 Retention Guidance

Align CSW retention with **SIEM/ISO/internal policy**. Federal-style programs often target **multi-year** cold storage for select events—implement via **forward-and-store**, not console-only retention.

### 11.3 Companion Products

| Gap area | Recommended companion |
|---|---|
| Cross-domain correlation, case management | Cisco XDR |
| Deep endpoint telemetry | EDR (Cisco or third party) |
| Long-term search & compliance queries | SIEM (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, etc.) |
| Email and web initial access | Secure Email/Web Gateway |

---

## 12. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Declaring “full ATT&CK coverage” from CSW alone | Publish a **pairing matrix**: which tactics are CSW-primary vs SIEM/EDR-primary. |
| Baseline window too short (misses month-end jobs) | Run ADM ≥ 30 days; include patch and financial close cycles. |
| Beaconing detected only in CSW console | Export **flow time series** to SIEM for periodicity / jitter analytics. |
| Over-blocking lateral admin paths | Model **jump hosts** explicitly; simulate before enforcement. |
| Ignoring agentless-only cloud segments | Combine **connectors + sensors** so east-west is not partially blind. |
| Credential-access alerts without EDR confirmation | Treat CSW as **corroboration** for T1003-class techniques pending kernel telemetry. |
