# Cisco Secure Workload — NIS2 Directive
## Technical Runbook | Essential & Important Entities (EU)

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** Directive (EU) 2022/2555 — NIS2 | **Transposition deadline:** 17 October 2024 | **Environment:** Hybrid

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Operators of essential or important entities in
scope of NIS2 across the EU — energy, transport, banking, financial
market infrastructure, health, drinking water, waste water, digital
infrastructure, ICT service management (B2B), public administration,
space, postal/courier, waste management, chemicals, food, manufacture
of critical products, digital providers, research — together with the
CISOs and security architects preparing those entities for their
national competent authority's review.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Article 21(2)(a) — risk-analysis and information-system security
  policies: do my policies translate into something a workload
  actually does, or do they live only in a policy document?*
- *Article 21(2)(b) — incident handling: when an incident occurs,
  what's my workload-level evidence pack, and can I assemble it
  inside the early-warning window of 24 hours?*
- *Article 21(2)(d) — supply chain security: do I know what my
  workloads are actually doing with each of my suppliers'
  endpoints — independent of the SBOM, the questionnaire, and the
  contract?*
- *Article 21(2)(e) — security in network and information systems
  acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability
  handling and disclosure: when a CVE drops on a library inside one
  of my containers, can I show which workloads are exposed and which
  paths attackers could traverse to reach them, on the same day?*
- *Article 21(2)(f) — policies and procedures to assess the
  effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures: what do I
  show a competent authority as evidence that the measures are
  *operating effectively*, not just *implemented*?*
- *Article 21(2)(i) — human resources security, access control and
  asset management: where is the asset-management telemetry that
  feeds the rest of the programme?*
- *Article 21(2)(j) — multi-factor authentication, secured voice/video
  and emergency communications, secured workload-to-workload
  channels: how do I demonstrate that workload-to-workload
  communication is restricted to what is authorised?*
- *Article 23 — reporting: when something major happens, can I meet
  the 24h early-warning, 72h notification, and 1-month final-report
  cadence with the same evidence pack each time?*
- *If senior management is personally liable under Article 20(1), what
  artefact do they look at to discharge that liability with confidence?*

**What you'll need.** Your entity's NIS2 classification (essential
vs. important — affects supervisory regime), your asset inventory,
the list of services your management body has identified as in scope,
your current incident-response runbook, your current supplier register,
and the contact details of your competent authority and CSIRT.

**Where to start.** Section 1 to align on what NIS2 actually requires
(it is broader and less prescriptive than DORA); section 2 if you're
mapping CSW to the ten Article 21(2) measures one-by-one; section 4
if reporting under Article 23 is the open item; section 5 if supply-
chain visibility is the gap; section 7 if you need the auditor /
competent-authority response cookbook.

**Important.** NIS2 places personal liability on management bodies
(Art. 20(1)) and explicit training obligations on them (Art. 20(2)).
Nothing in this runbook substitutes for that governance. CSW gives
the management body the *evidence* it needs to discharge that
accountability with confidence; it does not discharge it on the body's
behalf.

## 1. Overview

NIS2 replaces NIS1 and applies to a far broader set of sectors and
entities. It establishes:

- A **two-tier scope**: essential entities (more intensive supervision
  and higher fines) and important entities (lighter ex-post
  supervision).
- A **risk-management framework** in Article 21(2) listing 10
  cybersecurity measures every in-scope entity must implement.
- A **harmonised reporting regime** in Article 23 with three
  deadlines: 24-hour early warning, 72-hour incident notification,
  1-month final report.
- **Management body accountability** in Article 20 with personal
  liability and a training obligation.
- **Supervisory and enforcement** regimes in Articles 32–33 with
  fines up to €10m or 2% of worldwide turnover (essential entities).

CSW is most directly relevant to seven of the ten Article 21(2)
measures and to the technical evidence layer underneath Article 23
reporting. Identity, awareness training, cryptography, and HR-process
controls are addressed by complementary parts of the Cisco Security
portfolio (Duo, Identity Services Engine, Umbrella) and by the
customer's own programme.

## 2. Article 21(2) — The Ten Measures

NIS2 is *measure-based* rather than control-prescriptive. Each
measure below is paraphrased; consult the official text and any
implementing acts for the binding wording.

### (a) Policies on risk analysis and information system security

**What it requires.** Documented risk analysis and policies for
information-system security, proportionate to the risk.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Convert each policy clause that describes a workload behaviour
        into a CSW Intent
  → "PII workloads must not communicate with the internet" → DENY policy
  → "Production must not call non-production" → DENY policy
  → "Plaintext protocols are not used for sensitive data" → DENY policy

Step 2: For each Intent, run in Simulation
  → Simulation surfaces the gap between policy-on-paper and reality

Step 3: Resolve the gap
  → Either: change the application (close the gap)
  → Or: document a time-bound exception in the workspace notes
  → Either way, the policy is now grounded in observable behaviour
```

**Evidence:** Workspace export showing each policy Intent with
in-scope workload count, current Simulation status, and exception list.

---

### (b) Incident handling

**What it requires.** Capability to detect, respond to and recover from
incidents.

**CSW Implementation:** see §3 (Detection) and §4 (Reporting Evidence).

**Evidence:** Detection rule catalogue (with last-modified dates),
SIEM forwarding configuration, mean-time-to-detect by service.

---

### (c) Business continuity, including backup management and crisis management

**What it requires.** Recovery, backup, and crisis management.

**CSW position:** Out of scope for backup/recovery primitives. CSW
contributes by:
- providing the segmentation that limits incident blast radius
  (so fewer assets need recovery), and
- preserving forensic flow data through a recovery event so post-
  incident review (Art. 21(2)(b)) is grounded in evidence.

**Evidence:** Containment policy applied per IBF; pre/post recovery
flow comparison.

---

### (d) Supply chain security

**What it requires.** Aspects related to the supply-chain security
relationship between each entity and its direct suppliers / service
providers.

**CSW Implementation:** see §5.

---

### (e) Security in network and information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability handling and disclosure

**What it requires.** Secure development, vulnerability management,
and coordinated disclosure handling.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous workload vulnerability inventory
  CSW UI → Vulnerabilities → Workloads
  Filter: severity ≥ High AND ibf=true → priority remediation queue
  Output: per-workload CVE, CVSS, exploit availability, EPSS

Step 2: Pre-deployment vulnerability gating
  → CI/CD gate: query CSW API for CVE exposure of the candidate image
  → Block deployment if the image introduces a Critical/Exploitable
    CVE not present in production already

Step 3: Vulnerability-to-flow correlation
  → For each High/Critical CVE: which workloads are affected, what
    other workloads talk to them, what's the actual reachable
    attack path?
  → This is the artefact your competent authority and ENISA will
    increasingly expect under Art. 21(2)(e) and the CRA-aligned RTS.
```

**Evidence:** Weekly vulnerability backlog by criticality, aged;
CI/CD gate audit log; CVE-to-attack-path report per major
vulnerability event.

---

### (f) Policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures

**What it requires.** Demonstrate that the measures are *effective*,
not just present.

**CSW Implementation — the "effectiveness" pack:**
```
For each Article 21(2) measure CSW supports, produce one piece of
*operating effectiveness* evidence per quarter:

  Measure (a): policy-vs-observed Simulation diff (gap closure rate)
  Measure (b): MTTD trend per service, MTTR trend per incident class
  Measure (d): supplier egress drift count (new endpoints per quarter)
  Measure (e): CVE backlog trend by severity, mean-time-to-patch
  Measure (i): workloads without required asset labels (drift count)
  Measure (j): denied workload-to-workload connections per period

Bundle into a quarterly "NIS2 Article 21(2)(f) effectiveness pack"
that the management body reviews under Art. 20(1).
```

**Evidence:** Quarterly effectiveness pack (PDF/CSV).

---

### (g) Basic cyber hygiene practices and cybersecurity training

**CSW position:** Training is out of scope. Hygiene baseline (patch
status, configuration drift, dormant accounts) — CSW contributes
patch and process telemetry to populate the hygiene dashboard the
management body uses to confirm the baseline is met.

**Evidence:** Patch posture report; process anomaly summary.

---

### (h) Policies and procedures regarding the use of cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption

**CSW position:** CSW does not provide cryptographic primitives. It
contributes by enforcing policies that *require* encrypted protocols
and *deny* plaintext (HTTP, FTP, Telnet, plain LDAP) on sensitive
scopes (see Article 21(2)(a) implementation above).

**Evidence:** Policy export showing plaintext-protocol DENY rules
in force on sensitive scopes.

---

### (i) Human resources security, access control and asset management

**What it requires (asset-management portion).** Maintain a current
asset inventory and apply access control proportionate to risk.

**CSW Implementation — asset-management baseline:**
```
Step 1: Sensor coverage on every server, VM and container
Step 2: Mandatory label set:
  service:        [in-scope service identifier]
  data_class:     personal | sensitive | confidential | public
  nis2_in_scope:  true | false
  owner:          [team]
  environment:    prod | non-prod
Step 3: Daily drift report
  → New workloads without labels = onboarding gap
  → Removed workloads = offboarding evidence
```

**Evidence:** Per-service inventory export; label-coverage trend.

---

### (j) Use of multi-factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secured voice, video and text communications and secured emergency communication systems within the entity, where appropriate

**CSW position:** MFA itself is provided by Cisco Duo or equivalent.
CSW addresses the *workload-to-workload* analogue of "secured
communication" by:
- enforcing identity- and label-based segmentation (workload identity
  is the equivalent of "MFA between systems"), and
- denying connection paths that the policy doesn't explicitly allow.

**Evidence:** Segmentation workspace export; deny-by-default policy
proof.

---

## 3. Article 21(3) — All-Hazards Approach (Detection)

NIS2 expects the measures above to be applied with an "all-hazards"
mindset. CSW contributes the workload-anomaly detection layer:

```
Layer 1 — Behavioural rules (signature-style)
  CSW UI → Defend → Forensics → Rules
  Cover: privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement,
         credential access, defence evasion, exfiltration

Layer 2 — Conversation-graph anomalies
  Auto-flag new edges in the dependency graph (workload starts
  talking to something it never talked to before)
  Auto-flag changes in port/protocol distribution per workload

Layer 3 — Vulnerability + reachability fusion
  When a new exploit-in-the-wild CVE drops, automatically intersect
  CVE-affected workloads × current reachable inbound paths
  → Prioritised "attackable today" list
```

All three feed the SOC SIEM with NIS2-relevant labels so they roll
into reporting under Art. 23 with the right context.

---

## 4. Article 23 — Reporting

NIS2 establishes a single reporting flow with three deadlines (subject
to Member State implementing law and any further ENISA guidance):

| Phase | Deadline | Required content |
|---|---|---|
| Early warning | **Within 24 h** of becoming aware of a significant incident | Initial assessment, indication of cross-border / malicious origin, request for cross-border assistance if needed |
| Incident notification | **Within 72 h** of becoming aware | Updated assessment, indicators of compromise, severity & impact estimates |
| Final report | **Within 1 month** of the notification | Detailed description, root cause, remediation, cross-border impact summary |

Plus an **intermediate update** on request from the competent authority
or CSIRT.

**CSW Implementation — Reporting Evidence Pack:**
```
For each significant incident, assemble from CSW:

  (1) Affected workload set
      → Inventory query: hostnames, IPs, OS, service labels, ownership
  (2) Time-anchored flow record
      → Source, destination, port, byte counts, timestamps
      → Geographic context for the cross-border indicator
  (3) Process activity record
      → Every process spawned on affected workloads in the window
  (4) Software footprint at time of incident
      → Package list, CVE exposure as it stood at the moment of impact
  (5) Containment evidence
      → Policy applied; flow drop counts; time-to-quarantine
  (6) Cross-border footprint
      → Destinations / origins outside the home Member State
        (informs Art. 23(2) cross-border indicator)

These six artefacts populate every phase of the Art. 23 flow without
re-collecting data. The 24-hour early warning is short on detail by
design — the same six artefacts get progressively more complete by the
72-hour notification and the 1-month final report.
```

**Evidence:** Incident dossier per significant event; aggregate
trend report fed into Art. 21(2)(f) effectiveness pack.

---

## 5. Article 21(2)(d) — Supply Chain Security (Technical Lens)

NIS2 supply-chain security is broader than DORA's third-party-risk
pillar — it covers product suppliers, service providers, and the
quality of the *direct supplier's* own cybersecurity practices.

CSW addresses the *what is my workload actually doing with my
suppliers* question:

```
Step 1: Enumerate supplier-bound egress per in-scope service
  CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  Filter: source_scope = service=X AND destination_ip ∉ internal_ranges
  → Group by destination FQDN/IP; rank by byte count, frequency

Step 2: Reconcile observed vs. supplier register
  → For every observed external destination, locate the corresponding
    entry in the supplier register
  → Flag missing / undocumented supplier endpoints

Step 3: Enforce supplier-egress allow-listing
  ALLOW: in-scope workloads → {register-listed supplier endpoints}
  DENY:  in-scope workloads → all other external destinations
  → Run in Simulation; resolve gaps; promote to Enforce

Step 4: Continuous monitoring with management notification
  → CSW alert on new external destination from in-scope service
  → Routes to compliance / supplier-management function for register
    update under Art. 21(2)(d)
```

**Evidence:** Per-service supplier flow report; register-vs-observed
delta; egress policy enforcement diff.

> **Caveat.** A supplier's *internal* security posture remains
> contractual / questionnaire-based unless that supplier also runs
> CSW (or comparable workload telemetry) and shares evidence.

## 6. Article 20 — Governance Pack for the Management Body

Under Article 20(1), management bodies "approve the cybersecurity
risk-management measures" and "supervise their implementation," and
"can be held liable for infringements." Article 20(2) requires them to
"follow training" so they have sufficient knowledge to assess the
measures.

The simplest way for the body to discharge this is the **quarterly
NIS2 pack**:

1. Asset-inventory drift summary (Art. 21(2)(i))
2. Segmentation policy diff and exception status (Art. 21(2)(a), (j))
3. Incident summary with MTTD/MTTR per service (Art. 21(2)(b))
4. Vulnerability backlog aged by severity (Art. 21(2)(e))
5. Supplier egress drift summary (Art. 21(2)(d))
6. Effectiveness metrics per measure (Art. 21(2)(f))
7. Open competent-authority findings and remediation status

This pack is the artefact a management body member can confidently
sign-off on, and the artefact a competent authority will increasingly
ask for as evidence of *operating effectiveness*, not just policy.

## 9. Related Frameworks

NIS2 overlaps materially with:

- **DORA** — for financial-sector entities, DORA generally applies as
  *lex specialis* over NIS2 for the same control surface (see
  [DORA runbook](../DORA/CSW-DORA-Technical-Runbook.md)).
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — Annex A controls map closely to Art. 21(2)
  measures (see [ISO 27001 runbook](../ISO-27001-2022/CSW-ISO27001-Technical-Runbook.md)).
- **NIST SP 800-207** — segmentation and continuous-monitoring
  expectations align with the seven ZTA tenets (see
  [800-207 runbook](../NIST-800-207/CSW-NIST-800-207-Technical-Runbook.md)).
- **NIST SP 800-53** — for cross-jurisdiction programmes, 800-53
  controls give a useful detailed mapping for Article 21(2)(e), (f),
  (i) (see [800-53 runbook](../NIST-800-53/CSW-NIST-800-53-Technical-Runbook.md)).

## 10. Disclaimer

This runbook describes how Cisco Secure Workload product capabilities
can support a NIS2 programme. It is **not** legal, regulatory, or
audit advice. NIS2 is implemented through Member State law that may
add or refine requirements; classification as essential vs. important,
incident significance thresholds, and supplier-related obligations
are determined by your own management body and qualified counsel,
working with the relevant national competent authority and CSIRT.
Always validate against the latest implementing acts, ENISA guidance,
and Member State transposition before formal use.
