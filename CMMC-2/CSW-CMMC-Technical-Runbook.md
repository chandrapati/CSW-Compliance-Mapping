# Cisco Secure Workload — CMMC 2.0 (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)
## Technical Runbook | Level 2 Lead, with Level 1 / Level 3 Deltas

**Version:** 1.0 (draft — pending SME review) | **Standard:** CMMC 2.0 (final rule effective December 16, 2024) | **Audience:** DoD contractors and subcontractors handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) | **Environment:** Hybrid (on-prem + cloud) supporting the CUI/FCI scope

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Defense Industrial Base (DIB) organisations
that hold or are seeking DoD contracts subject to DFARS 252.204-7012
(safeguarding CUI), or to the broader DFARS 252.204-7021 CMMC clause
once it appears in your contracts. The default depth in this
runbook is written for **CMMC Level 2** because that's where the
bulk of the technical work — and the bulk of CSW alignment — lives.
Level 1 and Level 3 deltas are called out where the work materially
changes.

**Why CMMC and not just NIST 800-171 or 800-53?** CMMC 2.0 doesn't
invent new controls. It is the DoD's *certification* mechanism that
your organisation has implemented the controls already required
under DFARS 252.204-7012:

- **Level 1 (Foundational, 15 safeguards)** — implements the 15
  basic safeguarding requirements from FAR 52.204-21. Self-attested
  annually. Required for any contract handling FCI.
- **Level 2 (Advanced, 110 controls)** — implements **all 110
  controls of NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**. Self-assessed (for some
  contracts) or third-party-assessed via a C3PAO every 3 years.
  Required for any contract handling CUI.
- **Level 3 (Expert, ~134 controls)** — Level 2 plus a selected
  subset of NIST SP 800-172 enhanced security requirements.
  Government-led assessment. Required for the highest-criticality
  contracts.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *AC.L2-3.1.1 / 3.1.2 (Limit access; restrict to authorised
  functions): can I produce evidence that workload-level access is
  enforced and that segmentation between FCI/CUI scope and
  out-of-scope estate is real?*
- *AU.L2-3.3.1 / 3.3.2 (Audit records; CUI access traceability):
  can I produce per-user, per-process, per-flow audit records for
  every action involving a CUI-bearing workload, retained for the
  contract-required period?*
- *CM.L2-3.4.1 / 3.4.2 / 3.4.6 (Baseline configurations; security
  configuration; least functionality): can I show the baseline
  configuration of every CUI-scope workload, detect drift from
  it, and demonstrate that only necessary functions/ports/services
  are running?*
- *RA.L2-3.11.2 / 3.11.3 (Vulnerability scanning; remediate
  vulnerabilities): can I produce continuous CVE inventory per
  CUI-scope workload, with remediation tracking on an SLA the
  C3PAO will accept?*
- *SC.L2-3.13.1 / 3.13.5 / 3.13.6 (Boundary protection; deny by
  default; allow by exception): can I demonstrate workload-level
  deny-by-default with a documented allow-list, and show that the
  CUI scope has a defined and enforced boundary?*
- *SI.L2-3.14.1 / 3.14.6 / 3.14.7 (Identify/correct flaws; monitor
  for attacks; identify unauthorised use): can I show monitoring
  evidence at the workload level for the CUI scope, with detection
  rules sufficient to support the C3PAO assessment?*

**What you'll need.** Your current **CUI scope diagram** (the
authoritative answer to "where does CUI live and through what
systems does it flow?"), your current System Security Plan (SSP)
and Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M), your most recent NIST
SP 800-171 self-assessment score, and your target CMMC level. CSW
augments the SSP and POA&M; it does not author them.

**Where to start.** Section 2 if you're scoping CSW relative to the
CUI boundary; sections 3–4 if AC and AU are the audit gap; section
5 if CM (configuration management) is the open item; section 6 for
RA (vulnerability assessments); section 7 for SC (boundary
protection); section 8 for SI (system & information integrity).

**Important.** CMMC 2.0 assessment is performed by a Certified Third-
Party Assessor Organisation (C3PAO) for Level 2 certified-assessed
scope. Nothing in this runbook substitutes for the SSP, POA&M, or
the C3PAO engagement. CSW gives the assessment evidence that
satisfies many of the technical objectives the C3PAO will look for.

## 1. Overview

CMMC 2.0 final rule (DFARS 252.204-7021 / 32 CFR Part 170) was
published October 15, 2024 and became effective December 16, 2024.
DoD contracts will phase in CMMC requirements over the subsequent
three years.

**The three CMMC 2.0 levels:**

| Level | Name | Controls | Assessment | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundational | 15 (FAR 52.204-21) | Annual self-attestation | Contract handles FCI |
| 2 | Advanced | 110 (NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2) | Self-assessment or C3PAO every 3 years (per contract) | Contract handles CUI |
| 3 | Expert | Level 2 + selected NIST SP 800-172 enhancements | Government-led | Highest-criticality contracts |

**Where CSW fits across the 14 NIST 800-171 control families
(which are CMMC Level 2):**

| Family | Title | CSW relevance |
|---|---|---|
| AC | Access Control | **Direct** (workload-level enforcement) |
| AT | Awareness & Training | Out of scope (HR/training) |
| AU | Audit & Accountability | **Direct** (per-flow + per-process telemetry) |
| CA | Security Assessment | Supporting (continuous monitoring evidence) |
| CM | Configuration Management | **Direct** (baseline + drift) |
| IA | Identification & Authentication | Supporting (identity is upstream) |
| IR | Incident Response | **Direct (evidence)** (forensic reconstruction) |
| MA | Maintenance | Supporting |
| MP | Media Protection | Out of scope |
| PE | Physical Protection | Out of scope |
| PS | Personnel Security | Out of scope |
| RA | Risk Assessment | **Direct** (continuous CVE + reachability) |
| SC | System & Communications Protection | **Direct** (boundary protection, segmentation) |
| SI | System & Information Integrity | **Direct** (monitoring, detection, integrity) |

CSW is direct on six families (AC, AU, CM, RA, SC, SI), supporting
on four (CA, IA, IR evidence, MA), and out of scope on four (AT,
MP, PE, PS).

## 2. CUI Scope Identification and Boundary Labelling

The **CUI scope** is the most consequential decision in a CMMC
assessment. Anything in scope must implement all 110 Level 2
controls; anything out of scope is exempt. The wider the scope,
the larger the certification effort.

CSW does not define the CUI boundary — that is a data-classification
exercise driven by your contracts and your data flows. CSW *does*
host the labels that make the boundary enforceable and auditable.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Get the CUI scope determination from your CUI-handling owner
  → Per workload:
      cui_scope:        in-scope | security-protection-asset (SPA) |
                        contractor-risk-managed | out-of-scope
      cui_role:         processes | stores | transmits
      cmmc_level:       l1 | l2 | l3
      contract_id:      [reference to contracting vehicle]
      enclave:          [logical CUI enclave name]

Step 2: Apply labels to every CSW-managed workload
  CSW UI → Inventory → Bulk Label
  → Mandatory for any workload supporting in-scope contracts

Step 3: Build CSW Scopes per CUI enclave
  CSW UI → Organize → Scopes → New
  → Recommended hierarchy:
        Root
        └── DIB-Estate
            ├── CUI-Enclaves
            │   ├── Enclave-A (cui_scope=in-scope)
            │   ├── Enclave-B (cui_scope=in-scope)
            │   └── Enclave-N
            ├── Security-Protection-Assets (SPA)
            │   ├── Identity-PKI
            │   ├── SIEM-and-Monitoring
            │   ├── Vulnerability-Mgmt
            │   └── Backup-and-Recovery
            └── Out-of-Scope (default-deny target)

Step 4: Validate scope membership against the SSP
  → Cross-check CSW count vs. SSP-documented system list
  → Reconcile any delta with the CUI-handling owner before sign-off
```

**Evidence:** Per-enclave membership snapshot (CSV) with workload
identity, OS, owner, CUI role, contract reference, and last-seen
timestamp. This becomes the CSW companion to your SSP system
inventory.

**Level 1 delta:** Level 1 only handles FCI; the scope is broader
but the controls are simpler. Apply `cmmc_level: l1` and use the
same scope structure.

**Level 3 delta:** Level 3 inherits all Level 2 scope; add
`cmmc_level: l3` to the most-sensitive enclaves. The additional
NIST 800-172 enhancements typically tighten existing controls
rather than add new control families.

## 3. AC — Access Control

### 3.1 AC.L1-3.1.1 / AC.L2-3.1.1 — Limit System Access

Limit system access to authorised users, processes, and devices
acting on behalf of authorised users.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Workload-level deny-by-default at the CUI enclave boundary
  CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation → New Workspace
  Name: cmmc-{enclave-name}
  Scope: cui_scope=in-scope AND enclave=[name]

Step 2: Build allow-list per documented system function
  → Use ADM to compute as-observed clusters
  → Reject "noise" clusters; rename to system-function names
  → Each cluster becomes a documented allow rule

Step 3: Run in Simulation 30+ days; resolve gaps with system owner
Step 4: Promote to Enforce; gate by change-management approval
```

### 3.2 AC.L2-3.1.3 — Control Information Flow

Control the flow of CUI in accordance with approved authorisations.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enumerate observed CUI-enclave egress
  CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  Filter: source_scope=cui-enclaves AND destination ∉ enclave

Step 2: Reconcile against the SSP's documented information flows
  → Observed-but-undocumented = candidate exception or violation
  → Documented-but-not-observed = candidate for SSP cleanup

Step 3: Enforce flow boundary via CSW policy
  → ALLOW only documented inter-enclave flows
  → DENY everything else with audit logging
```

### 3.3 AC.L2-3.1.20 — Verify and Control Connections to External Systems

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Enumerate all egress from cui_scope=in-scope workloads
Step 2: For each external destination, verify it is documented in
        the SSP's external-systems register
Step 3: Egress allowlist per enclave; alert on net-new external
        destinations
```

### 3.4 AC.L2-3.1.22 — Control CUI on Publicly-Accessible Systems

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Identify any cui_scope=in-scope workload that is also
        internet-reachable
        → CSW reachability query
Step 2: For each, validate that the architecture is intentional
        and that the workload satisfies the boundary protection
        requirements (SC.L2-3.13.5)
Step 3: Continuous monitoring for net-new internet-reachable
        CUI workloads
```

**Evidence (AC family):** (a) per-enclave segmentation policy
export with simulation→enforcement log; (b) information-flow
reconciliation against SSP; (c) external-systems register reconciled
against observed egress; (d) internet-exposure inventory.

---

## 4. AU — Audit and Accountability

### 4.1 AU.L2-3.3.1 — Create Audit Records

Create and retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed
to enable monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of
unlawful or unauthorised system activity.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Configure SIEM forwarding for every cui_scope=in-scope
        workload
  CSW UI → Manage → Data Tap → SIEM
  → Splunk HEC, QRadar, Sentinel, Cisco XDR, syslog
  → Forward: per-flow records, process events, policy violations,
    behavioural detections, vulnerability events

Step 2: Confirm CMMC-grade audit detail
  → Per-flow: source, destination, port, byte counts, timestamps,
    process attribution, scope context
  → Per-process: command line, parent-child, file accesses,
    network activity
  → Per-event: detection rule fired, severity, evidence
```

### 4.2 AU.L2-3.3.2 — Ensure Action Traceability

Ensure that the actions of individual system users can be uniquely
traced to those users.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Process telemetry includes user attribution where the OS
        sensor supports it
Step 2: Pair CSW process events with identity-system events at the
        SIEM (CSW + AD/IdP correlation)
Step 3: For shared-credential investigations, CSW process timeline
        narrows the window for identity correlation
```

### 4.3 AU.L2-3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.8 — Alert Failures, Correlate, Protect Logs

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: CSW data-tap monitor: alert on forwarder failure
Step 2: SIEM correlation rules combining CSW + identity + endpoint
        telemetry
Step 3: SIEM-side immutable log storage (CSW does not store the
        long-term archive; the SIEM does)
```

### 4.4 AU.L2-3.3.9 — Limit Management of Audit Logging Functionality

**CSW Implementation:** CSW administrative access is RBAC-controlled;
configure separate roles for audit-log management vs. policy
management; document in the SSP.

**Evidence (AU family):** (a) SIEM forwarding configuration; (b)
sample audit record showing per-flow + per-process detail; (c) audit
retention configuration; (d) CSW RBAC export for audit-management
roles.

---

## 5. CM — Configuration Management

### 5.1 CM.L2-3.4.1 — Establish Configuration Baselines

Establish and maintain baseline configurations and inventories of
organisational systems.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Capture baseline per cui_scope=in-scope workload
  CSW UI → Investigate → Inventory → Workload → Software & Packages
  → Auto-captured: OS, kernel, package list, version, install date,
    listening ports, running processes
  → Snapshot daily to CSW data tap; this is the CMMC L2 baseline

Step 2: Schedule baseline export per enclave; route to SSP appendix
```

### 5.2 CM.L2-3.4.2 — Establish Security Configuration Settings

**CSW Implementation:** CSW does not configure host hardening; that's
upstream (CIS Benchmarks, STIGs, vendor hardening guides). CSW
*verifies* that the resulting state matches expectations through
the baseline + drift report.

### 5.3 CM.L2-3.4.3 / 3.4.4 — Track and Approve Changes

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Daily diff between today's baseline and yesterday's
Step 2: For each diff: package change, port change, process change
Step 3: Correlate change timestamp against change-ticket system
        → Authorised change = log + close
        → Orphan change (no ticket) = unauthorised-change candidate
        → Route to incident process
```

### 5.4 CM.L2-3.4.6 — Employ Principle of Least Functionality

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Per-workload listening-port + service inventory
Step 2: Cross-reference against the documented baseline
  → Ports running but not in baseline = candidate for closure
  → Ports with no observed flow in 90 days = candidate for closure
Step 3: Generate quarterly "least functionality" review report
```

### 5.5 CM.L2-3.4.7 — Restrict Use of Nonessential Programs/Functions

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Software inventory + allow-list deviation alert
Step 2: For Level 3: behavioural prevention of unauthorised
        executable launches
```

**Evidence (CM family):** (a) baseline export per workload; (b)
daily drift log with disposition; (c) quarterly least-functionality
review; (d) allow-list deviation log.

---

## 6. RA — Risk Assessment

### 6.1 RA.L2-3.11.1 — Conduct Risk Assessments

CSW does not conduct the formal risk assessment. CSW supplies
inputs.

### 6.2 RA.L2-3.11.2 — Scan for Vulnerabilities

Scan for vulnerabilities in the system and applications periodically
and when new vulnerabilities affecting the system are identified.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous CVE inventory at workload level
  CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Per-workload CVE list with CVSS, exploit availability, EPSS

Step 2: Filter by cui_scope=in-scope → priority remediation queue

Step 3: Schedule weekly export to CMMC evidence store

Step 4: Tie remediation progress to POA&M entries
```

### 6.3 RA.L2-3.11.3 — Remediate Vulnerabilities

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Patch SLA per CVSS band (org-defined)
  → Common: Critical 30 days, High 60 days, Medium 90 days for
    CMMC Level 2; tighter for Level 3

Step 2: For deferred patches, document compensating controls
        in CSW workspace notes; reference in POA&M

Step 3: Trend report monthly; route to security leadership
```

**Evidence (RA family):** (a) per-CUI-workload CVE list dated to
cadence; (b) patch SLA compliance trend; (c) compensating-control
register; (d) POA&M items linked to CSW vuln IDs.

---

## 7. SC — System and Communications Protection

This is the densest CSW alignment in CMMC L2.

### 7.1 SC.L2-3.13.1 — Monitor, Control, and Protect Communications at System Boundaries

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Define the CUI enclave boundary in CSW
  → Workspace per enclave; default deny across the boundary

Step 2: Allow-list documented inter-enclave flows
Step 3: Continuous monitoring + alerting on attempted boundary
        crossings outside the allow-list
```

### 7.2 SC.L2-3.13.2 — Employ Architectural Designs

**CSW Implementation:** CSW supplies the **as-observed** architecture
that complements the **as-designed** architecture in your SSP
network diagrams. Reconcile them; resolve any delta.

### 7.3 SC.L2-3.13.5 — Implement Subnetworks for Publicly-Accessible Components

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Identify publicly-accessible components in CUI scope
        (typically a small set: web frontends, partner APIs)
Step 2: Verify CSW policy puts them in their own scope
Step 3: Verify CSW policy denies all flow from those components
        into the deeper CUI enclave except documented paths
```

### 7.4 SC.L2-3.13.6 — Deny by Default; Permit by Exception

**CSW Implementation:** This is what CSW segmentation **is**. The
default-deny, allow-by-exception posture is enforced at the workload
identity layer; every allow rule traces back to a documented
business need.

### 7.5 SC.L2-3.13.7 — Prevent Split Tunneling on Remote Devices

**CSW Implementation:** CSW reports observed flows from remote/
VPN sources; alert on flows that suggest split-tunnel behaviour
(simultaneous internal + external destination from the same
endpoint). Primary control is VPN configuration; CSW is the
detective check.

### 7.6 SC.L2-3.13.16 — Protect CUI Confidentiality at Rest

**CSW Implementation:** Out of scope — encryption at rest is
upstream. CSW *does* alert if a CUI workload exposes services
not intended for its role (e.g. listening on port 80 when it
should only serve port 443).

**Evidence (SC family):** (a) per-enclave segmentation policy
export; (b) as-observed architecture diagram (ADM export); (c)
public-component scope documentation; (d) split-tunnel alert log.

---

## 8. SI — System and Information Integrity

### 8.1 SI.L2-3.14.1 — Identify, Report, and Correct System Flaws

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous CVE inventory feeds the flaw-identification step
        (see RA.L2-3.11.2)

Step 2: Daily configuration baseline + drift catches integrity
        deviations beyond CVEs

Step 3: SIEM forwarding routes detections to the SOC for response
```

### 8.2 SI.L2-3.14.2 — Provide Protection from Malicious Code

CSW is layered with endpoint AV. CSW behavioural rules catch
post-exploitation patterns (privilege escalation, lateral movement,
unusual outbound) that endpoint AV may miss.

### 8.3 SI.L2-3.14.3 — Monitor System Security Alerts and Advisories

**CSW Implementation:** CSW threat intel feeds enrich CVE
prioritisation; alert routing connects threat intel into the SOC
workflow.

### 8.4 SI.L2-3.14.6 — Monitor Communications

Monitor organisational systems including inbound and outbound
communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of
potential attacks.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Per-workload flow telemetry forwarded to SIEM
Step 2: Behavioural rule catalogue running against telemetry
Step 3: Conversation-graph anomaly detection (new edges, port
        distribution shifts) alerts on indicator-class events
```

### 8.5 SI.L2-3.14.7 — Identify Unauthorised Use

**CSW Implementation:** Process + flow telemetry shows what's
running; identity-aware policy shows who's authorised. Combination
catches unauthorised use patterns at the workload tier.

**Evidence (SI family):** (a) detection rule catalogue; (b) sample
alerts with full forensic context; (c) anomaly alert log; (d)
threat-intel enrichment configuration.

---

## 9. IR — Incident Response (Evidence Side)

### 9.1 IR.L2-3.6.1 / 3.6.2 / 3.6.3 — IR Process

CSW does not author the IR plan. CSW supplies the forensic
substrate for IR steps.

**CSW Implementation — Six-Artefact Bundle:**
```
For each incident on a CUI-scope workload:

  (a) Affected workload set (CUI scope, contract reference)
  (b) Time-anchored flow record (process attribution)
  (c) Process activity record
  (d) Software footprint at time of incident (CVE exposure)
  (e) Containment evidence (quarantine policy, time-to-quarantine)
  (f) Configuration baseline diff (pre vs post)
```

**Evidence (IR family):** (a) standard incident dossier template;
(b) MTTD/MTTR metrics by enclave; (c) sample dossier per quarter.

## 11. Level 1 (FCI) Delta

Level 1 implements 15 basic safeguarding requirements from FAR
52.204-21 (which are themselves derived from a small subset of
NIST 800-171). Level 1 is annual self-attestation; no C3PAO.

CSW's Level 1 contribution:

| FAR 52.204-21 (b)(1) clause | CSW capability |
|---|---|
| (i) Limit system access to authorised users | Workload-level segmentation |
| (ii) Limit access to types of transactions / functions | Allow-list per documented function |
| (iii) Verify and control external connections | Egress allowlist |
| (iv) Control information posted on publicly-accessible systems | Internet-reachability inventory |
| (v) Identify users / processes / devices | Sensor + cloud connector inventory |
| (vi) Authenticate users | (Out of scope — identity upstream) |
| (vii) Sanitise / destroy media | (Out of scope) |
| (viii) Limit physical access | (Out of scope) |
| (ix) Escort visitors / monitor | (Out of scope) |
| (x) Audit physical access | (Out of scope) |
| (xi) Maintain audit logs | SIEM forwarding |
| (xii) Identify / report / correct flaws timely | CVE inventory + remediation tracking |
| (xiii) Provide protection from malicious code | Behavioural rules |
| (xiv) Update malicious code mechanisms | (Endpoint AV upstream; CSW threat intel feeds CVE) |
| (xv) Periodic system / real-time scans | Continuous CVE + flow telemetry |

---

## 12. Level 3 Delta

Level 3 inherits Level 2 plus selected NIST 800-172 enhanced
security requirements addressing Advanced Persistent Threats. The
additions tighten existing practices rather than add new families.

CSW's Level 3 contribution highlights:

| Practice area | Level 3 enhancement | CSW capability |
|---|---|---|
| 3.4.2e | Employ automated mechanisms to detect misconfigurations | Daily drift report with automated escalation |
| 3.11.1e | Threat-aware risk assessments | Threat-intel-enriched CVE prioritisation |
| 3.13.4e | Employ physical / logical isolation | Tighter per-enclave segmentation; identity-aware allow rules |
| 3.14.1e | Verify integrity of security-critical software | Software inventory diff + behavioural integrity checks |
| 3.14.6e | Use threat hunting and indicators | Behavioural rules + conversation-graph anomalies + threat-intel hunting queries |
| 3.14.7e | Establish + maintain threat-modelling | ADM dependency graph as input to threat-modelling |

## 13. C3PAO Assessor Response Guide

When a C3PAO asks for evidence at Level 2 assessment:

| Assessor asks | You provide |

## 14. Related Frameworks

CMMC 2.0 inherits heavily from NIST and from the CSF / CIS layered
view:

- **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2** — CMMC Level 2 IS NIST 800-171. Read
  this runbook for L2 work.
- **NIST SP 800-172** — CMMC Level 3 enhanced controls source. CSW
  capabilities for L3 are noted in §12 above.
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** — superset of 800-171. The 800-53
  runbook covers CMMC L2 with broader context. See
  [800-53 runbook](../NIST-800-53/CSW-NIST-800-53-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture)** — the architectural
  pattern that satisfies many SC/AC controls at depth. See
  [800-207 runbook](../NIST-800-207/CSW-NIST-800-207-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **NIST CSF 2.0** — the outcomes wrapper that cites 800-171 as
  Informative References under PR/DE/RS Subcategories. See
  [CSF runbook](../NIST-CSF-2/CSW-CSF-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **CIS Controls v8.1** — many CIS Safeguards align directly with
  800-171 practices. See
  [CIS runbook](../CIS-Controls-v8/CSW-CIS-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **DFARS 252.204-7012** — the contractual basis for CMMC; the
  technical content sits in NIST 800-171 which this runbook
  addresses.

## 15. Disclaimer

This runbook is **draft v1** describing how Cisco Secure Workload
capabilities can support a CMMC 2.0 programme at Level 2 (with
Level 1 and Level 3 deltas). It is **not** legal or compliance
advice and does not constitute a finding of compliance.

Specifically:

- The DoD publishes the authoritative CMMC 2.0 text at
  https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/. The DCMA Defense Industrial
  Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC) and the Cyber AB
  publish authoritative assessment guidance. Always validate
  against the **current effective rule** (DFARS 252.204-7021 / 32
  CFR Part 170) and against any DoD class deviations.
- CMMC Level 2 assessment is performed by a Certified Third-Party
  Assessor Organisation (C3PAO) or, for limited contracts, by
  self-assessment. Nothing in this runbook substitutes for the SSP,
  POA&M, or the C3PAO engagement.
- Mapping a CSW capability to a 800-171 practice does not by itself
  satisfy the practice. The C3PAO will look for a documented
  process, evidence cadence, and management review behind the
  technical implementation. CSW supplies the technical evidence;
  the SSP and POA&M document the process around it.
- CSW does not address AT, MP, PE, or PS families. Reference your
  HR, media-handling, physical-protection, and personnel-security
  programmes for those.

This document should receive subject-matter-expert review for both
CMMC 2.0 currency (the rule and assessment guidance evolve) and
current Cisco product capability before being relied upon in a
formal compliance engagement.
