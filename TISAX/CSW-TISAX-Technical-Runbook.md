# Cisco Secure Workload — TISAX / VDA ISA
## Technical Runbook | Automotive Suppliers and OEM Partners

**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** TISAX® (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange), assessment of the VDA ISA (Information Security Assessment) catalogue published by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA)  
**Use Case:** Information security level evidence, prototype-protection segmentation, data-protection segmentation, supplier readiness for ENX/TISAX assessment

> **Framework version note.** TISAX is the assessment label operated by the ENX Association; VDA ISA is the underlying control catalogue. VDA ISA has multiple published versions (5.x at the time of writing) and the assessment objectives (AL 1 / AL 2 / AL 3 / AL High / AL Very High) determine which catalogues apply (Information Security, Prototype Protection, Data Protection). Topic area names (e.g. "Asset Management", "IT Security / Cyber Security", "Identity and Access Management", "Cryptography", "Operations Security", "Communications Security", "System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance", "Supplier Relationships", "Incident Management", "Business Continuity Management", "Compliance") are stable across recent versions; specific control numbering is **not** stable across versions. This runbook references **topic areas by name**, not specific VDA ISA control numbers — validate the control numbering against your assessment's catalogue version.
>
> **CSW UI navigation note.** Cisco does not yet publish TISAX-specific CSW UI navigation; framework-specific paths are on the product roadmap. This runbook describes CSW *capabilities* and the *evidence artifacts* they produce.

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Automotive suppliers and OEM development partners preparing for, maintaining, or renewing a TISAX assessment; CISO function, information security officer, and the team owning the VDA ISA self-assessment (the "ISA workbook") and the ENX assessor engagement.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Can I produce technology asset and information-asset evidence to support the Asset Management topic area?*
- *Can I show network segmentation between prototype-handling environments and the general IT estate to support Prototype Protection?*
- *Can I evidence access privileges and segmentation between processing environments handling personal or special-category data to support Data Protection?*
- *Can I produce continuous control evidence rather than point-in-time samples for IT Security / Cyber Security and Operations Security topics?*
- *Can I produce forensic timeline evidence for the Incident Management topic in the event of an assessment-relevant incident?*

**What you'll need.** Information asset register, prototype project / development project register (if Prototype Protection is in scope), data protection register (where applicable), VDA ISA self-assessment workbook draft, ENX assessment objective(s) and assessment scope ID, CMDB or cloud asset inventory, and supplier register.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping a deployment; 5–7 if you are designing and simulating policy; 9–10 if you are preparing the ISA workbook evidence or the on-site assessment within the next quarter.

## 1. Overview

TISAX is not a control standard — it is a sharing mechanism operated by the ENX Association for VDA ISA assessment results across the automotive industry. The underlying VDA ISA catalogue is structured by topic areas with maturity-level scoring per control. The assessment objectives (e.g. AL 2, AL 3, AL High, AL Very High) determine which controls are in scope.

CSW supports **technical evidence** for the network-, workload-, and reachability-related topics of the VDA ISA catalogue: asset management at the workload layer, communications security, operations security, incident management forensic inputs, and elements of identity and access management at the workload-to-workload layer. CSW does **not** replace organisational policy, training, supplier assurance, physical security, prototype physical handling, identity lifecycle, cryptography assurance, or the assessment itself.

### VDA ISA Topic Areas and CSW Relevance (topic names; not version-specific control IDs)

| VDA ISA topic area | CSW relevance |
|---|---|
| Information Security Policies & Organisation | Out of scope (governance) |
| Asset Management | Workload inventory; scope and label evidence; reachability |
| Identity and Access Management | Workload-to-workload allowlist (complements identity-layer IAM) |
| Cryptography | Plaintext-protocol detection on regulated paths (detection only) |
| Operations Security | Continuous workload monitoring; vulnerability + reachability data |
| Communications Security | Workload-level segmentation; ADM-derived allowlist; policy enforcement |
| System Acquisition, Development, Maintenance | Out of scope for code-level controls; CSW shows reachability of dev / build environments |
| Supplier Relationships | Outbound flow visibility to supplier endpoints |
| Information Security Incident Management | Forensic flow + process telemetry |
| Business Continuity Management | Approved flow baseline as one input to recoverability evidence |
| Compliance | Periodic evidence pack inputs |
| Prototype Protection (when in scope) | Workload-level isolation of prototype environments; reachability evidence |
| Data Protection (when in scope) | Workload-level isolation of personal-data environments; reachability evidence |

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor & Connector Deployment (Days 1–5)

- Install software sensors on representative workloads in monitoring mode
- Connect cloud accounts as read-only CSW cloud connectors for in-scope cloud workloads
- Apply Day-1 labels: `application`, `env`, `data_class`, `prototype`, `assessment_objective`, `owner`, `compliance=tisax`
- Maintain a `cannot-instrument` register for managed SaaS and appliances
- Retain Phase-1 sensor inventory baseline

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Information Asset Mapping (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Suggested Scope Architecture

```
Root Scope
└── TISAX
    ├── Information-Security-Scope
    │   ├── Production-Workloads
    │   ├── Engineering-Workloads
    │   └── Corporate-Adjacent
    ├── Prototype-Protection-Scope         (only if PP is in assessment scope)
    │   ├── Prototype-Engineering
    │   └── Prototype-Storage
    ├── Data-Protection-Scope              (only if DP is in assessment scope)
    │   ├── Personal-Data-Stores
    │   └── Personal-Data-Processing
    ├── Security-Services
    └── Supplier-Edges
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters

```
Filter: Personal-Data-Stores
  - Tag: data_class = personal | special-category
  - Listening port: 1521, 3306, 5432, 1433, 27017

Filter: Prototype-Engineering-Candidates
  - Tag: prototype = true | confidential-project
  - Hostname / application pattern matches engineering / PLM systems

Filter: Supplier-Edges
  - Destination outside on-prem and cloud allow-lists
  - Tag: managed_by = supplier
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters for VDA ISA |
|---|---|---|
| `data_class` | personal, special-category, prototype, internal, public | Anchors Information Security, Prototype Protection, Data Protection topic areas |
| `prototype` | true, false | Marks workloads in Prototype Protection scope (if applicable) |
| `assessment_objective` | AL2, AL3, AL-High, AL-Very-High | Aligns evidence stringency to the assessment objective |
| `application` | <named app> | Connects workloads to information assets |
| `env` | production, integration, dev, test | Environment segregation evidence |
| `owner` | <named function> | Accountability |
| `compliance` | tisax | Filters CSW evidence to the TISAX scope |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

Run ADM for each scope across a 2-week-minimum window. Document, per cluster:

| Question | VDA ISA topic |
|---|---|
| Which workloads receive connections from outside the assessment scope? | Communications Security |
| Are flows into personal-data environments minimised and approved? | Data Protection |
| Are flows into prototype environments minimised and approved? | Prototype Protection |
| Are database connections encrypted? | Cryptography (detection input) |
| Which workloads reach supplier endpoints? | Supplier Relationships |
| Are there unexpected lateral connections inside engineering environments? | Operations Security / Incident Management |

Use ADM clusters to confirm or correct `data_class`, `prototype`, and `assessment_objective` labels with information asset owners.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35)

### 6.1 TISAX-Aligned Policy Framework

**Absolute policies (Prototype Protection example):**

```
DENY  Any                       → Prototype-Protection-Scope        (default deny inbound)
DENY  Prototype-Protection      → Internet                          (no direct internet egress)
DENY  Corporate-Adjacent        → Prototype-Protection              (admin only via approved jump paths)
```

**Allowlist policies (least privilege):**

```
ALLOW Prototype-Engineering     → Prototype-Storage                tcp/<approved-port>
ALLOW Personal-Data-Processing  → Personal-Data-Stores             tcp/<db-port-tls>
ALLOW Production-Workloads      → Security-Services                tcp/443
ALLOW Jump-Hosts                → In-Scope-Workloads               tcp/22, tcp/3389
```

**Catch-all:**

```
LOG   Any                       → Prototype-Protection-Scope        (unmatched inbound)
LOG   Personal-Data-Stores      → Any                               (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Lifecycle

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2 weeks | Validate the candidate policy |
| 2 | Enforcement (high-confidence rules only) | 1 week | Enforce obvious deny rules |
| 3 | Full Enforcement | Ongoing | Workload allowlist enforced; monthly exception review |

Workspace snapshots = Communications Security / Operations Security control-implementation evidence.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Topic Mapping with CSW Evidence

| VDA ISA topic area | What CSW produces | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| Asset Management | Workload inventory; scope + label export | Asset and classification evidence at the workload layer |
| Identity and Access Management | Policy workspace and enforcement / violation log | Workload-to-workload privilege evidence (complements identity layer) |
| Cryptography | Plaintext-flow detection on regulated paths | Detection input only |
| Operations Security | Continuous monitoring; vulnerability + reachability | Operations control evidence |
| Communications Security | Policy workspace; ADM-derived allowlist; observed flows | Segmentation evidence |
| Supplier Relationships | Outbound flow summary to supplier endpoints | Reconciliation against the supplier register |
| Information Security Incident Management | Flow + process search across the incident window | Forensic timeline |
| Prototype Protection (if in scope) | Isolation evidence for Prototype-Protection scope | Reachability into prototype environment is constrained |
| Data Protection (if in scope) | Isolation evidence for Personal-Data scope | Reachability into personal-data environment is constrained |
| Compliance | Periodic evidence pack (Section 10.1) | Assessor work-paper input |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability & Risk Management

Use reachability-weighted CVE data:

```
Priority 1: Critical CVE on Prototype-Protection-Scope with inbound reachability
Priority 2: Critical CVE on Personal-Data-Stores with inbound reachability
Priority 3: Critical CVE on supporting workloads with reach into either of the above
```

Document compensating controls in the policy workspace exception register; this register is itself evidence for the Operations Security / Information Security topic.

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting

| Alert | Trigger | VDA ISA topic |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorised reach to Prototype-Protection | Any unapproved source → PP scope | Prototype Protection |
| Unauthorised reach to Personal-Data-Stores | Any unapproved source → PD scope | Data Protection |
| Plaintext on regulated paths | HTTP / unencrypted DB protocol from PP or PD scopes | Cryptography (detection) |
| Lateral movement inside engineering scope | New east-west flow outside baseline | Operations Security |
| Supplier egress anomaly | New egress to a non-listed supplier endpoint | Supplier Relationships |
| Policy violation | Enforced policy block triggered | Communications Security |
| Sensor offline | Agent stops reporting | Evidence integrity |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry

Retain per incident:

- Flow log scoped to affected workload(s) and time window
- Process search output
- Policy workspace state at the time of the incident
- Vulnerability snapshot for the affected workload(s)
- Supplier-edge reach summary if relevant

---

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Assessment / Surveillance Cycle (quarterly recommended; annually for assessment renewal)

| Evidence item | CSW source area | VDA ISA topic |
|---|---|---|
| Workload inventory | Inventory export | Asset Management |
| Scope + label membership | Scope membership export | Asset Management |
| Approved vs. observed flows | ADM workspace export | Communications Security |
| Policy workspace snapshot | Policy workspace export | Communications Security / IAM |
| Policy enforcement / violations | Policy analysis output | Operations Security |
| Vulnerability + reachability | Vulnerability report scoped to TISAX | Operations Security |
| Supplier egress summary | Flow search filtered to supplier endpoints | Supplier Relationships |
| Incident timeline sample | Flow + process search | Incident Management |
| Prototype-Protection isolation evidence | Inbound/outbound reach summary to PP scope | Prototype Protection |
| Data-Protection isolation evidence | Inbound/outbound reach summary to PD scope | Data Protection |
| Exception register | Policy workspace exceptions list | Operations Security |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- **Monthly:** scope / inventory hygiene; supplier egress reconciliation
- **Quarterly:** policy workspace review; refresh evidence pack 10.1
- **Annually / per surveillance:** refresh the VDA ISA self-assessment evidence references
- **Continuously:** policy drift detection; ADM re-run every 90 days

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Citing specific VDA ISA control numbers without confirming the catalogue version | Reference topic areas by name; pin specific control numbering only after confirming the workbook version |
| Treating TISAX as a single control standard | TISAX is the assessment label; the catalogues are Information Security, Prototype Protection, Data Protection |
| Prototype Protection assumed in scope when it is not on the assessment objective | Confirm assessment objectives in the ENX portal; map scope accordingly |
| `prototype` and `data_class` labels missing | Reconcile project register ↔ CSW labels at the start of each surveillance window |
| Encryption assumed by port | Confirm by process + observed handshake, not by TCP port |
| Supplier egress in `internal` scope | Maintain supplier register; ensure CSW labels mirror it |
