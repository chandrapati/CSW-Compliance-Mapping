# Cisco Secure Workload — CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1
## Technical Runbook | Implementation Group 2 Lead, with IG1 / IG3 Deltas

**Version:** 1.0 (draft — pending SME review) | **Standard:** CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1 | **Audience:** Security teams adopting or maintaining CIS Controls posture, particularly those targeting Implementation Group 2 (IG2) | **Environment:** Hybrid (on-prem + cloud + containers)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Organisations using the CIS Critical Security
Controls (currently v8.1) as their primary cyber programme reference,
or as an objective scorecard alongside another framework (HIPAA, SOC
2, PCI, NIST CSF, NIST 800-53). The default depth in this runbook is
written for **Implementation Group 2 (IG2)** because that's the
band most enterprise programmes operate in. IG1 and IG3 deltas are
called out where the work materially changes.

**Why CIS Controls and not just NIST 800-53?** The CIS Controls are
an **operationally ordered, prioritised** subset of what the broader
NIST catalogue describes. Where 800-53 lists 1,000+ controls
covering every conceivable scenario, CIS Controls compress the
universe to 18 Controls and ~153 Safeguards, rank-ordered by what
defends against actual attacks first. Many programmes use CIS as the
"what to do this year" view and 800-53 as the "what to satisfy in
the contract" view.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Control 1 (Inventory of Enterprise Assets) and Control 2
  (Inventory of Software Assets): can I produce a current,
  authoritative inventory of every workload and the software running
  on it, refreshed continuously rather than monthly?*
- *Control 4 (Secure Configuration): can I detect drift from baseline
  configuration on every workload, attribute the change to a request
  ticket, and produce evidence per quarter?*
- *Control 7 (Continuous Vulnerability Management): for every CVE
  that drops, can I show which workloads are exposed, how reachable
  they are from current attacker positions, and how that backlog has
  trended?*
- *Control 8 (Audit Log Management): am I retaining audit-quality
  logs at the workload level for the period the Safeguards specify,
  with process attribution that supports incident reconstruction?*
- *Control 12 (Network Infrastructure Management) and Control 13
  (Network Monitoring and Defense): can I prove segmentation between
  trust zones is enforced at the workload, not just configured at
  the edge, and that east-west traffic between workloads is
  observed and alertable?*
- *Control 17 (Incident Response Management): when an event is
  declared, can I assemble a forensic dossier (workloads, processes,
  flows, packages, baselines) within minutes rather than days?*

**What you'll need.** Your current self-assessed CIS Implementation
Group rating (IG1 / IG2 / IG3), your existing inventory source of
truth (CMDB, cloud-asset inventory, or both), your patch and change
management ticketing system, and the SIEM destination for log
forwarding. CSW augments these; it does not replace them.

**Where to start.** Section 2 if you're scoping CSW relative to your
IG; sections 3–5 if Controls 1, 2 and 4 are the priority gap;
section 6 if Controls 7 and 13 are the audit gap; section 7 if
Control 8 logging retention is the open item; section 9 for the
incident-response evidence pack (Control 17).

## 1. Overview

CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1 organises 18 Controls and ~153
Safeguards by Implementation Group:

| IG | Typical org profile | Safeguards |
|---|---|---|
| IG1 | Small org, basic staff, limited resources, commodity hardware | 56 Safeguards |
| IG2 | Mid-to-large org, dedicated security function, mixed sensitivity | 130 Safeguards (cumulative with IG1) |
| IG3 | Large org, mature security, sensitive data, advanced threats | 153 Safeguards (cumulative with IG2) |

A given Safeguard ID (e.g. `1.1`) is the same across IGs; what
changes is whether it's in scope and the rigour expected. This
runbook leads with IG2 expectations and notes IG1/IG3 deltas where
the work materially changes.

**Where CSW fits across the 18 Controls:**

| Control | Title | CSW relevance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets | **Direct** — workload inventory, hardware/cloud asset attribution |
| 2 | Inventory and Control of Software Assets | **Direct** — installed software inventory per workload |
| 3 | Data Protection | Supporting (egress observation; primary control is DLP) |
| 4 | Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software | **Direct** — baseline + drift |
| 5 | Account Management | Out of scope (identity/PAM tooling) |
| 6 | Access Control Management | Supporting (workload-side enforcement; identity is upstream) |
| 7 | Continuous Vulnerability Management | **Direct** — continuous CVE inventory + reachability context |
| 8 | Audit Log Management | **Direct** — workload-level flow + process telemetry to SIEM |
| 9 | Email and Web Browser Protections | Out of scope (email/web stack) |
| 10 | Malware Defenses | Supporting (behavioural rules layer with endpoint AV) |
| 11 | Data Recovery | Out of scope (backup product) |
| 12 | Network Infrastructure Management | Supporting (workload-side; perimeter is upstream) |
| 13 | Network Monitoring and Defense | **Direct** — east-west visibility, anomaly detection, deny-by-default |
| 14 | Security Awareness and Skills Training | Out of scope (HR/training) |
| 15 | Service Provider Management | Supporting (technical egress lens; contractual is upstream) |
| 16 | Application Software Security | Supporting (CVE inventory feeds the SDLC) |
| 17 | Incident Response Management | **Direct (evidence)** — forensic reconstruction bundle |
| 18 | Penetration Testing | Supporting (reachability validation; pre/post test reports) |

CSW directly addresses six Controls (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13), supports
six more (3, 6, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17 evidence side, 18), and is
explicitly out of scope on five (5, 9, 11, 14, plus AT/MP/PE/PS-style
items inside other controls).

## 2. Implementation Group Calibration

Before deploying, calibrate CSW scope to your IG target. The same
sensors get installed; what differs is the breadth of the policy
workspace and the cadence of evidence pulls.

| Aspect | IG1 baseline | IG2 baseline (default) | IG3 add |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sensor coverage | All servers + admin workstations | All workloads incl. containers + cloud workloads | All workloads incl. ephemeral / serverless via cloud connectors |
| Inventory refresh (Control 1.1) | Monthly | Weekly | Continuous (real-time alert on net-new) |
| Software inventory (Control 2.1) | Monthly | Bi-weekly | Continuous + signed allow-list (2.6) |
| Config baseline (Control 4.1) | Documented | Documented + automated drift detection | Drift attribution to change ticket |
| Vulnerability scan cadence (Control 7.5) | Monthly | Weekly | Continuous, with reachability context |
| Log retention (Control 8.10) | 90 days | 90 days + central SIEM | Per regulatory obligation; common is 1 year+ |
| Segmentation (Control 12.4) | Macrosegmentation | Macro + microsegmentation for sensitive scopes | Microsegmentation everywhere; deny-by-default default |
| Network monitoring (Control 13.1) | Border / SIEM | Border + east-west sampling | East-west everywhere with behavioural detection |

**CSW Implementation:** apply IG-aligned labels at workload onboarding:
```
Step 1: Apply CIS context labels
  CSW UI → Inventory → Bulk Label
  Mandatory labels:
    cis_ig:           ig1 | ig2 | ig3
    asset_class:      server | workstation | container | cloud-vm | serverless
    data_sensitivity: public | internal | confidential | regulated
    business_unit:    [BU identifier]
    environment:      production | staging | dev

Step 2: Build CSW Scopes per (cis_ig, environment, data_sensitivity)
  CSW UI → Organize → Scopes → New
  → IG2 scopes inherit IG1 expectations and add IG2 Safeguards

Step 3: Configure cadence policies per IG tier
  → CSW reports (Inventory, Software, Vulnerability) scheduled to
    the cadence row above for the relevant IG
```

---

## 3. Control 1 — Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 1.1 (inventory), 1.2 (address
unauthorised assets), 1.3 (utilise active discovery), 1.4 (DHCP
logging — not CSW), 1.5 (passive discovery).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Achieve sensor coverage (Safeguard 1.1)
  → Linux:   yum/dnf/apt + systemctl enable tetd
  → Windows: MSI install + service verification
  → Containers: DaemonSet sensor for K8s; per-node sensor for ECS/AKS/GKE
  → Cloud:   External Orchestrators (AWS/Azure/GCP) for asset metadata

Step 2: Configure cloud connectors for agentless inventory
  CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → AWS account / Azure subscription / GCP project
  → CSW polls API for instance inventory regardless of agent state
  → Captures Safeguard 1.5 passive discovery for ephemeral workloads

Step 3: Reconcile against your authoritative source (CMDB)
  → Schedule weekly export from CSW inventory API
  → Diff against CMDB; investigate any delta
  → IG3: real-time alert on net-new workload not in CMDB

Step 4: Quarantine unauthorised workloads (Safeguard 1.2)
  → Pre-built CSW policy: deny-all except management plane
  → Apply to any workload tagged unauthorised=true
  → IG2 expectation: investigate and quarantine within 1 week;
    IG3 expectation: within 24 hours
```

**Evidence:** (a) inventory snapshot per IG cadence; (b) reconciliation
diff log against CMDB; (c) unauthorised-asset quarantine log.

**IG1 delta:** monthly inventory snapshot + manual diff is acceptable.
**IG3 delta:** continuous inventory with real-time net-new alerting and
sub-24-hour quarantine.

## 4. Control 2 — Inventory and Control of Software Assets

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 2.1 (software inventory), 2.2 (ensure
authorised software supported), 2.3 (address unauthorised software),
2.5 (allow-list), 2.6 (allow-list libraries).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous software inventory (Safeguard 2.1)
  CSW UI → Investigate → Inventory → Workload → Software & Packages
  → Auto-captured: package name, version, install date, source
  → Per-workload export available via API; aggregated by scope

Step 2: Detect unsupported software (Safeguard 2.2)
  → Cross-reference inventory against your supported-software list
  → Flag workloads running software past vendor support EOL
  → Route to platform team for upgrade or risk acceptance

Step 3: Detect unauthorised software (Safeguard 2.3)
  → Define allow-list per asset_class (server, workstation, container)
  → CSW alert: software outside the allow-list observed
  → IG2 expectation: investigate within 1 week
  → IG3 expectation: prevent execution via behavioural policy + alert

Step 4: Allow-list enforcement (Safeguards 2.5, 2.6)
  → IG2: allow-list documented; CSW alerts on deviation
  → IG3: allow-list enforced via behavioural policy (block on
    unknown binary execution); CSW process telemetry feeds the
    enforcement decision
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-workload software inventory dated to cadence;
(b) unsupported-software register; (c) unauthorised-software alert
log with disposition.

**IG1 delta:** monthly inventory; manual review of unauthorised
software is sufficient.
**IG3 delta:** allow-list enforcement (block, not just alert) on
unknown binary execution.

## 5. Control 4 — Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 4.1 (process for configuration), 4.2
(secure configuration of network infra), 4.4 (default deny via
firewall — see Control 13), 4.5 (automatically manage default
accounts — IG3), 4.6 (secure configuration of software).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Capture configuration baseline per workload (Safeguard 4.1)
  → CSW continuously inventories: OS + kernel, package list, listening
    ports, running processes, key file presence
  → Snapshot daily to CSW data tap; this is the IG2 baseline of record

Step 2: Drift detection (Safeguard 4.1)
  → Daily diff between today's snapshot and yesterday's
  → Per-workload report: what changed in packages, ports, processes
  → IG2 expectation: review weekly; investigate unexplained drift
  → IG3 expectation: drift attribution to a change ticket within 24h

Step 3: Hardening enforcement via CSW segmentation policy (4.4, 4.6)
  → Default deny inbound to every workload except documented services
  → Plaintext-protocol DENY (HTTP, FTP, Telnet, LDAP plaintext)
  → Limit outbound to documented destinations per asset_class

Step 4: Tie drift to change-management (Safeguard 4.1)
  → Correlate CSW-observed change timestamp against change-ticket
    timestamp
  → Orphan changes (CSW-detected, ticket-absent) = unauthorised
    change candidates; route to incident process
```

**Evidence:** (a) baseline export per workload; (b) daily drift log
with disposition; (c) segmentation policy export per scope.

**IG1 delta:** documented baseline; manual quarterly review.
**IG3 delta:** automated drift attribution; default-account
management automation tied to inventory.

## 6. Control 7 — Continuous Vulnerability Management

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 7.1 (process for vulnerability
management), 7.2 (process for remediation), 7.3 (automated patch
mgmt of OS), 7.4 (automated patch mgmt of apps), 7.5 (perform
automated vulnerability scans of internal assets), 7.6 (perform
automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed assets), 7.7
(remediate detected vulnerabilities).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Continuous CVE inventory at workload level (Safeguard 7.5)
  CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Per-workload CVE list with CVSS, EPSS, exploit availability
  → Updated continuously as the CSW CVE database refreshes
  → IG2 cadence: weekly export to remediation queue
  → IG3 cadence: continuous, real-time prioritisation

Step 2: Reachability-aware prioritisation (Safeguard 7.7)
  → CSW maps each CVE to the workload's actual ingress/egress
    paths in the conversation graph
  → Vulnerable port + actually reachable from internet = top priority
  → Vulnerable port + no observed flow + no reachable path = lower
    priority (validate compensating control before deferral)

Step 3: Track patch SLA per asset_class and CVSS band
  → Critical (9+) on internet-reachable: patch within 48 hours
  → High (7-8.9) on internal: patch within 30 days
  → Medium (4-6.9): patch within 60 days
  → Trend report monthly to security leadership

Step 4: Compensating controls when patching is delayed
  → Restrict source set for the vulnerable port via CSW policy
  → Add behavioural detection for known exploit patterns
  → Document the compensating control in workspace notes
  → This is the audit trail for "remediation" when patch is deferred
```

**Evidence:** (a) per-workload CVE list dated to IG cadence; (b)
patch SLA compliance trend; (c) compensating-control register for
deferred patches.

**IG1 delta:** monthly scan; manual prioritisation acceptable.
**IG3 delta:** continuous scanning, automated reachability scoring,
sub-week patch SLA on critical exposed assets.

## 7. Control 8 — Audit Log Management

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 8.1 (log management process), 8.2
(collect audit logs), 8.5 (collect detailed audit logs), 8.7
(retain audit logs), 8.10 (retain audit logs for 90 days minimum),
8.11 (conduct audit log reviews).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Configure SIEM forwarding (Safeguard 8.2)
  CSW UI → Manage → Data Tap → SIEM
  → Splunk HEC, QRadar, Sentinel, Cisco XDR, syslog
  → Forward: workload flow records, process events, policy violations,
    behavioural detections, vulnerability events

Step 2: Confirm IG2-grade logging detail (Safeguard 8.5)
  → Per-flow: source, destination, port, byte counts, timestamps,
    process attribution, scope context
  → Per-process: command line, parent-child, file accesses, network
    activity
  → Per-event: detection rule fired, severity, evidence

Step 3: Retention (Safeguards 8.7, 8.10)
  → IG2 minimum: 90 days at the SIEM
  → For regulated data: extend per applicable framework (HIPAA: 6 yr;
    PCI: 1 yr active + 1 yr archive; etc.)

Step 4: Audit log reviews (Safeguard 8.11)
  → IG2: weekly review of CSW alert summary; quarterly trend review
  → IG3: SOC reviews real-time; CSW alerts feed playbook automation
```

**Evidence:** (a) SIEM forwarding configuration screenshot; (b)
log retention policy and compliance evidence; (c) sample log review
minutes per cadence.

**IG1 delta:** logs to local file with weekly review; SIEM
forwarding optional.
**IG3 delta:** real-time SOC review with playbook automation;
extended retention per compliance overlay.

## 8. Control 12 — Network Infrastructure Management

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 12.1 (network infrastructure
maintained), 12.2 (use secure protocols), 12.4 (establish &
maintain architecture diagrams), 12.5 (centralise network AAA).

CSW does not configure routers or switches. It contributes by
making the **workload-side** enforcement layer visible and
documented, which feeds Safeguards 12.4 (architecture diagrams) and
12.2 (secure protocols).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Generate the workload-side architecture diagram (12.4)
  CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping → Workspace
  → ADM clusters become the as-observed application architecture
  → Export the dependency graph; pair with your network team's
    diagram for a complete view

Step 2: Detect insecure protocols in flight (12.2)
  → CSW reports: any plaintext flow (HTTP, FTP, Telnet, LDAP, SMTP)
  → Alert on insecure flows from sensitive scopes
  → Block via segmentation policy as remediation
```

**Evidence:** (a) ADM dependency export; (b) plaintext-flow alert log.

---

## 9. Control 13 — Network Monitoring and Defense

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 13.1 (centralised monitoring), 13.2
(deploy host-based intrusion detection — see also Control 10), 13.3
(network intrusion detection), 13.4 (perform traffic filtering
between network segments), 13.5 (manage access control for remote
assets), 13.6 (collect network traffic flow logs), 13.7 (deploy
host-based intrusion prevention — IG3), 13.8 (deploy network
intrusion prevention — IG3), 13.9 (deploy port-level access
control — IG3), 13.10 (perform application-layer filtering — IG3).

This is the densest CSW alignment in the entire CIS Controls. CSW
runs at the workload, observes every flow, applies behavioural
analytics, enforces segmentation, and forwards to the SIEM.

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Centralised monitoring (Safeguard 13.1, 13.6)
  → CSW collects every flow on every CSW-managed workload
  → Forwarded to SIEM continuously; retained at CSW for the data
    retention window (typically 30 days; configurable)

Step 2: East-west traffic filtering (Safeguard 13.4)
  → Build segmentation policy per scope; deny-by-default
  → Run in Simulation 30+ days; resolve legitimate-but-blocked flows
  → Promote to Enforce; quarterly diff report

Step 3: Behavioural detection (Safeguards 13.2, 13.3)
  → Out-of-the-box rules: privilege escalation, persistence, lateral
    movement, suspicious child processes
  → Custom rules: encode org-specific abuse patterns
  → IG3: tie to playbook automation for sub-15-minute MTTR

Step 4: Anomaly detection (Safeguards 13.3, 13.8)
  → Conversation graph: flag new edges in workload-to-workload
    communication
  → Port/protocol distribution anomalies per workload

Step 5: Remote-asset access control (Safeguard 13.5)
  → Identify remote-management paths in CSW (VPN concentrators,
    bastion hosts, admin VPN ranges)
  → Limit allow rules for management protocols (22, 3389, WinRM) to
    those source sets only
```

**Evidence:** (a) segmentation policy export with simulation→
enforcement log; (b) detection rule catalogue; (c) anomaly alert
log; (d) flow telemetry retention configuration.

**IG1 delta:** flow logs at the border; simple deny rules; weekly
review of suspicious activity.
**IG3 delta:** Safeguards 13.7–13.10 layered (HIPS, NIPS, port-level
access, app-layer filtering); CSW behavioural rules feed automated
response.

---

## 10. Control 17 — Incident Response Management

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 17.1 (designate IR personnel), 17.2
(establish & maintain contact information), 17.3 (establish & maintain
IR process), 17.4 (test IR process), 17.5 (assign roles), 17.6
(define mechanisms for reporting), 17.8 (track post-incident
review).

CSW is not the IR playbook owner. CSW supplies the **evidence
substrate** that lets each step of the IR process produce defensible
artefacts.

**CSW Implementation — Six-Artefact IR Bundle:**
```
For each declared incident on a CSW-managed workload:

  (a) Affected workload set
      → Inventory query: hostnames, IPs, OS, scope labels, owner

  (b) Time-anchored flow record
      → CSW historical conversations: source, destination, port, byte
        counts, timestamps, process attribution

  (c) Process activity record
      → Every process spawned on affected workloads in the window

  (d) Software footprint at time of incident
      → Package list, CVE exposure at that moment (not "today")

  (e) Containment evidence
      → Quarantine policy applied; flow drop count after policy;
        time-to-quarantine

  (f) Post-incident control proof
      → Diff between pre-incident segmentation and remediated state
```

**Evidence:** (a) incident dossier per declared event; (b) MTTD/MTTR
trend per quarter; (c) post-incident review (Safeguard 17.8) inputs.

---

## 11. Control 18 — Penetration Testing (Supporting)

**IG2 Safeguards in scope:** 18.1 (establish & maintain pen test
program), 18.2 (perform periodic external pen tests), 18.3
(remediate pen test findings), 18.5 (perform periodic internal pen
tests).

**CSW Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Pre-test reachability baseline (Safeguard 18.5)
  → CSW "what-if" reachability query for the test scope
  → Output: who can reach what, on which port, with which identity
  → Hand to the red team as the engagement scoping document

Step 2: During test
  → Defenders may observe in "purple" mode
  → CSW alerts can be observed but not acted on without abort

Step 3: Post-test reachability comparison
  → Re-run reachability query; diff vs. pre-test
  → Document: which segmentation rules held, which were bypassed,
    which detections fired vs. missed (Safeguard 18.3 input)
```

**Evidence:** (a) pre-test reachability report; (b) red-team
activity reconstruction; (c) post-test gap analysis.

## 14. Related Frameworks

CIS Controls v8.1 maps cleanly to:

- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5** — CIS publishes an official 800-53
  mapping; many CIS Safeguards correspond to specific 800-53
  controls. See [800-53 runbook](../NIST-800-53/CSW-NIST-800-53-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **NIST CSF 2.0** — CIS Safeguards are commonly cited as
  Informative References under CSF subcategories. See
  [CSF runbook](../NIST-CSF-2/CSW-CSF-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **CMMC 2.0 (Level 2)** — both inherit heavily from NIST
  800-171 / 800-53. See
  [CMMC runbook](../CMMC-2/CSW-CMMC-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **PCI DSS v4.0** — many Reqs (1, 2, 7, 10, 11) align directly
  with CIS Controls 4, 6, 8, 13. See
  [PCI runbook](../PCI-DSS-v4/CSW-PCI-DSS-Technical-Runbook.md).
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — Annex A controls have substantial
  overlap with CIS Safeguards. See
  [ISO 27001 runbook](../ISO-27001-2022/CSW-ISO27001-Technical-Runbook.md).

## 15. Disclaimer

This runbook is **draft v1** describing how Cisco Secure Workload
capabilities can support a CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1
programme. It is **not** legal or compliance advice and does not
constitute a finding of compliance.

Specifically:

- CIS publishes the authoritative Safeguard text and IG mapping at
  https://www.cisecurity.org/. Always validate against the **current
  effective version** of the Controls.
- Mapping a Safeguard to a CSW capability does not by itself satisfy
  the Safeguard. Safeguards expect documented process, evidence
  cadence, and management review — CSW supplies the technical
  layer that those process requirements depend on.
- CSW does not address Controls 5, 9, 11, 14 in any meaningful way;
  reference your identity, email/web, backup, and training stacks
  for those.

This document should receive subject-matter-expert review for both
CIS Controls accuracy and current Cisco product capability before
being relied upon in a formal compliance engagement.
