# CSW compliance evidence playbook

> **Audience:** Security engineers, GRC analysts, and Cisco SEs who are **new to Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)** and need a repeatable way to turn CSW deployment into **assessor-ready evidence** for any framework in this repository.

Companion to [About CSW](./about-csw.md) and the per-framework **Technical Runbooks** (`*-Technical-Runbook.md`).

---

## What this playbook is (and is not)

| This playbook **is** | This playbook **is not** |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Step-by-step CSW operations for evidence collection | Legal or audit sign-off |
| A cadence you can run quarterly | A substitute for your QSA, OCR, or C3PAO |
| Framework-agnostic CSW mechanics | The full control text of HIPAA, PCI, etc. |

Every framework runbook maps **specific control IDs** to CSW artefacts. **Start here** for *how*; open the framework runbook for *which controls*.

---

## CSW in five minutes (new operators)

CSW protects **workloads** (servers, VMs, containers) — not the network perimeter alone.

```text
Agent on workload  →  observes processes + flows  →  CSW SaaS console
                              ↓
                    Scopes + labels (compliance boundary)
                              ↓
                    ADM (learn who talks to whom)
                              ↓
                    Policy workspace (allow / deny / log)
                              ↓
                    Monitor → Simulation → Enforce
                              ↓
                    Exports = audit evidence
```

### Console map

| Area | Menu path (typical) | Use for evidence |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Inventory | Investigate → Inventory / Workloads | Scope membership, agent health |
| Flows | Investigate → Flows / Flow Search | Who talked to whom, when, on which port |
| Processes | Investigate → Processes | Which binary opened the connection |
| ADM | Policy Lifecycle → ADM / Dependency map | Live application diagram |
| Policy | Defend → Segmentation / Workspaces | Allow/deny rules, simulation, enforce |
| Denied traffic | Defend → Denied Connections | Proof enforcement blocked a flow |
| Vulnerabilities | Investigate → Vulnerability | CVE + workload + reachability context |
| Agents | Manage → Agents / Sensors | Coverage %, enforcement mode |
| Connectors | Platform → Orchestrators | Cloud inventory without agents |
| Audit | Administration → Audit logs | Who changed policy in CSW |

### Modes (always in this order for compliance rollouts)

| Mode | Traffic impact | Evidence value |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Visibility / Monitor** | None — observe only | Baseline flows, ADM, scope proof |
| **Simulation** | None — predict blocks | Safe pre-enforcement report for change board |
| **Enforcement** | Blocks non-matching traffic | Primary segmentation control evidence |

**Never skip Simulation** before Enforce in regulated environments.

## The universal 4-phase evidence programme

Run this once per compliance boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave, SWIFT zone, etc.). Timelines assume a pilot scope of 20–200 workloads; scale phases proportionally.

### Phase 1 — Coverage and inventory (Days 1–10)

**Goal:** Prove every in-scope system component appears in CSW and is labeled.

| Step | Action | CSW location | Evidence artefact |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1.1 | Define in-scope IP/host list from compliance scope doc | (customer doc) | Scope document (input) |
| 1.2 | Install agents or enable cloud connectors | Manage → Agents; Platform → Connectors | Agent inventory export |
| 1.3 | Verify 100% of scope list appears in inventory | Investigate → Inventory (filter by label/subnet) | Screenshot + CSV export |
| 1.4 | Apply labels: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<class>`, `env:<tier>` | Inventory → Labels | Label policy doc |
| 1.5 | Create CSW **scope** matching compliance boundary | Scopes / App scopes | Scope definition export |

**Pass criteria:** No in-scope workload missing from inventory for >24 h without documented exception.

**CSW effectiveness:** Replaces manual CMDB reconciliation samples with **continuous** inventory tied to observed behaviour.

---

### Phase 2 — Behaviour baseline (Days 11–28)

**Goal:** Produce a **machine-generated** communication map assessors treat as stronger than static diagrams.

| Step | Action | CSW location | Evidence artefact |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2.1 | Start ADM on compliance scope; run ≥2 weeks (include billing/month-end if applicable) | ADM / Application Dependency Mapping | ADM cluster report |
| 2.2 | Document unexpected flows (scope creep, shadow IT, vendor egress) | Investigate → Flow Search | Anomaly flow export |
| 2.3 | Capture process context on critical flows (DB, auth, integration) | Flow detail → process column | Flow+process screenshot |
| 2.4 | Map ADM clusters to application owners; confirm data classification | (workshop) | Signed app-to-cluster table |
| 2.5 | Export dependency map for assessor | ADM → Export / screenshot | **Live network diagram** artefact |

**Pass criteria:** App owners attest ADM matches expected architecture; exceptions documented.

**CSW effectiveness:** PCI Req 1.2.1, HIPAA risk analysis, and NIST CM-2 all ask for **current** connectivity — ADM answers from telemetry, not last year's Visio.

---

### Phase 3 — Policy and simulation (Days 29–45)

**Goal:** Show **designed** isolation before you **enforce** it.

| Step | Action | CSW location | Evidence artefact |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 3.1 | Create policy workspace bound to compliance scope | Defend → Segmentation | Workspace config |
| 3.2 | Import ADM-suggested rules; add explicit DENY defaults | Policy editor | Policy export (JSON/CSV) |
| 3.3 | Run **Simulation** for 1–2 weeks | Workspace → Simulation mode | Simulation hit report |
| 3.4 | Remediate false positives with app owners | (change tickets) | Change log |
| 3.5 | Document compensating controls for rules deferred | (GRC register) | Exception register |

**Pass criteria:** Simulation shows no business-breaking denies; all unmatched flows either allowed by rule or logged.

**CSW effectiveness:** Simulation produces **change-board-ready** evidence — critical for HIPAA, PCI, and FedRAMP change control (CM-3, Req 6.4).

---

### Phase 4 — Enforcement and continuous proof (Day 46+)

**Goal:** Demonstrate controls **operate effectively** between audit cycles (PCI v4.0 language).

| Step | Action | CSW location | Evidence artefact |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 4.1 | Enable Enforcement on lowest-risk scope first | Workspace → Enforce | Enforcement screenshot |
| 4.2 | Run controlled negative test (unauthorized flow should fail) | ping/curl + Denied Connections | Test record + deny log |
| 4.3 | Export quarterly evidence pack (see table below) | Multiple | **Audit binder** |
| 4.4 | Integrate CSW alerts to SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.) | Platform → Integrations | SIEM sample events |
| 4.5 | Re-run ADM every 90 days; compare to policy baseline | ADM diff | Drift report |

**Pass criteria:** Denied Connections shows test violation; production apps stable; quarterly pack complete.

**CSW effectiveness:** Moves from **point-in-time** audit samples (SOC 2 CC6) to **continuous** workload-resident proof.

---

## Quarterly evidence pack (copy into every framework)

Export these every quarter (or per your assessor's cadence). Map columns to control IDs using your framework runbook Section 10+.

| # | Artefact | CSW source | Typical controls |
|---|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | Scope membership snapshot | Inventory → Export (filtered by compliance scope) | Scope / asset inventory |
| 2 | Agent coverage report | Manage → Agents (% active, enforce mode) | Monitoring / logging |
| 3 | Policy workspace export | Defend → Export policies | Access control / segmentation |
| 4 | Denied Connections log (90 days) | Defend → Denied Connections | Enforcement proof |
| 5 | ADM / dependency map | ADM export | Network diagram / data flows |
| 6 | Vulnerability report (scoped) | Investigate → Vulnerability | Risk analysis / patch priority |
| 7 | Policy change / audit log | Administration → Audit | Change management |
| 8 | Sample incident flow export | Investigate → Flow Search (if incident occurred) | Incident response |
| 9 | Simulation or enforcement attestation | Workspace status + sign-off | Operating effectiveness |
| 10 | Exception / break-glass register | (customer GRC) | Compensating controls |

Store exports in your GRC tool with: **date**, **scope**, **CSW tenant URL**, **exporting user**, **framework version**.

---

## API and automation (optional)

For repeatable evidence collection, use CSW OpenAPI (HMAC auth):

```bash
# Example: agent inventory
python3 csw_api.py GET /openapi/v1/sensors

# Example: inventory search by label
python3 csw_api.py POST /openapi/v1/inventory/search \
  '{"filter":{"type":"eq","field":"labels","value":"compliance:hipaa"},"dimensions":["ip","hostname","enforcement_status"],"limit":500}'
```

See [CSW-POV-Tooling](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-POV-Tooling) or Cursor skill `csw-api` for helper scripts. **Never commit API keys** to this repository.

## Pairing with the customer-facing report

| Document | Role |
|----------|------|
| **This playbook + framework runbook** | Engineers execute phases; GRC maps exports to control IDs |
| **Compliance Report (PDF/DOCX)** | Customer/auditor narrative; posture summary table |
| **Framework Scope Design Guide** | Workshop: which scopes/labels before Phase 1 |

Workflow: **Runbook → populate real exports → tailor Report placeholders → assessor review**.

---

## CSW effectiveness — why programmes choose it

| Compliance pain | Traditional approach | CSW approach |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| "Prove segmentation" | Annual firewall rule review + static diagram | Continuous enforce + Denied Connections |
| "Prove scope" | Spreadsheet vs. CMDB | Live inventory + labels + scope queries |
| "Prove logging" | SIEM only (may miss east-west) | Workload flow + process telemetry |
| "Prove vuln priority" | CVE list without reachability | CVE on workload + who can connect |
| "Prove lateral movement control" | Assume VLANs work | East-west policy at process/workload tier |
| "Prove change control" | Sample of change tickets | Policy audit log + ADM drift vs. baseline |

CSW does **not** replace governance, physical security, encryption key management, or formal penetration testing — it **compresses** the workload-resident slice of evidence into one queryable system.

## Next steps

1. Pick your framework folder → open `*-Technical-Runbook.md`.
2. Read **Reader's Guide** + **CSW primer** (injected section) for your industry.
3. Execute Phases 1–4 above; use framework Section 10 for control ID mapping.
4. Tailor the matching **Compliance Report** for leadership/auditor conversations.
5. Validate with your assessor before formal reliance — see [repository disclaimer](../README.md).
