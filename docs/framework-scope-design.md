# Cisco Secure Workload — Framework Scope Design Guide

<a id="top"></a>

Customer-facing scope and label patterns for Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)
compliance mapping workshops.

Use this guide before a proof-of-value, deployment planning workshop, or
evidence-readiness discussion. It helps teams translate framework language
into practical CSW scopes, labels, and evidence boundaries. These patterns
are starting points: validate final scope with the customer's architecture,
asset owners, compliance team, and assessor.

## Scope Design Principles

1. **Start from the protected service, not the tool.** Define the system,
   business function, data boundary, or regulated environment first; then
   map CSW scopes to that boundary.
2. **Separate regulatory scope from operational ownership.** A PCI CDE,
   HIPAA ePHI zone, CUI enclave, or DORA important business function may
   cross teams, clouds, and platforms.
3. **Use labels for policy and evidence.** Scopes should be generated from
   stable labels where possible so inventory, ADM, flow search, policy
   workspaces, and reports use the same vocabulary.
4. **Reconcile CSW coverage.** CSW evidence covers instrumented workloads
   and supported connector visibility. Reconcile gaps with the CMDB, cloud
   inventory, OT inventory, IAM, SIEM, vulnerability scanner, and GRC tools.
5. **Keep out-of-scope explicit.** Physical controls, legal obligations,
   cryptographic module validation, IAM/MFA, endpoint malware controls, and
   OT device enforcement usually require complementary controls.

## Framework Scope Design Table

| Framework | Customer scope anchor | Suggested CSW scope pattern | Primary evidence focus | Boundaries and complementary controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HIPAA Security Rule | ePHI applications, databases, clinical integrations, and business associate connections | `Healthcare-Org` > `ePHI-Zone` > app/service scopes such as `EHR`, `Billing`, `PACS`, `HL7`; separate `BAA-Partners` egress scope | ePHI workload isolation, access-path evidence, audit-control telemetry, risk-analysis inputs | HIPAA administrative, physical, legal, and BAA obligations remain outside CSW; validate PHI classification with privacy/compliance owners. **Epic sites:** see [CSW Epic EHR Microsegmentation Guide](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Epic-Microsegmentation-Guide) for tier-by-tier rollout. |
| SOC 2 Type II | The service organization's system boundary and selected Trust Services Criteria | `SOC2-System` > `Production`, `Supporting-Infra`, `Admin-Access`, `Vendor-Integrations`; align scope to system description | Operating-effectiveness evidence for segmentation, monitoring, change drift, incident investigation | SOC 2 criteria depend on the auditor's system description and control design; CSW augments IAM, change management, SIEM, and availability controls |
| PCI DSS v4.0 | Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), CDE-connected systems, and security-impacting systems | `PCI-Environment` > `CDE`, `CDE-Connected`, `Security-Services`, `Third-Party-Processors`, `Out-of-Scope-Validation` | CDE flow documentation, segmentation simulation/enforcement, policy exceptions, vulnerability exposure context | CSW does not replace QSA judgment, ASV scans, penetration testing, network security controls, or PCI governance requirements |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | FISMA/FedRAMP system boundary and SSP control implementation | `System-Boundary` > impact-level or component scopes such as `Moderate`, `High`, `Data-Store`, `App-Tier`, `Management` | AC, AU, CM, IR, RA, SC, and SI evidence for covered workloads | Full 800-53 scope includes many controls outside CSW: identity, personnel, physical, contingency, privacy, and governance controls |

| FIPS 140 | Systems handling regulated cryptographic use or plaintext-protocol risk | `Crypto-Review` > `Sensitive-Transport`, `Plaintext-Protocol-Candidates`, `FIPS-Required-Systems` | Detection/blocking of obvious plaintext transports and inventory support for cryptographic usage review | CSW is not a FIPS-validated cryptographic module; validation, key management, and module selection belong to FIPS-validated libraries/HSMs |
| NIST SP 800-207 | Zero Trust Architecture tenets for workload-to-workload access | `ZTA-Resources` > `Protected-Resources`, `Policy-Enforced-Flows`, `Observed-Dependencies`, `Exceptions` | Resource inventory, per-connection flow evidence, dynamic scoping, workload enforcement as one possible PEP placement | NIST ZTA also requires identity, device posture, policy decision architecture, and enterprise-wide telemetry beyond CSW |
| NIST SP 800-207A | PDP/PEP/PA/PIP component mapping for a cloud-native ZTA discussion | `ZTA-Components` > `PEP-Analogue`, `Policy-Workspace`, `Telemetry-PIP`, `SOAR-Integrated` | Illustrative traceability from CSW policy, enforcement, and telemetry to 207A-style logical components | Treat PDP/PEP/PA/PIP mapping as an analogue for workload segmentation, not a complete enterprise ZTA architecture |

## Label / Tag Recommendations

### Baseline Labels for Every Customer

Use a small, consistent baseline across all frameworks. Keep values stable
and controlled; avoid free-form spelling differences that split evidence.

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | `payments-api`, `ehr-core`, `identity` | Groups workloads into application scopes and ADM workspaces |
| `env` | `prod`, `stage`, `dev`, `test` | Separates production evidence from non-production noise |
| `owner` | `team-payments`, `clinical-apps`, `platform` | Connects policy exceptions and remediation to accountable teams |
| `data_class` | `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `phi`, `pci`, `cui` | Drives regulated data boundaries and evidence queries |
| `compliance` | `hipaa`, `pci`, `soc2`, `dora`, `cmmc`, `none` | Enables framework-specific scopes without duplicating inventory |
| `criticality` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | Supports prioritization, segmentation strictness, and incident response |
| `internet_exposed` | `true`, `false` | Helps identify boundary and attack-surface review candidates |
| `third_party` | `none`, `supplier-name`, `processor-name` | Supports supplier egress and business associate / processor reviews |
| `region` | `us-east`, `eu-west`, `site-001` | Supports residency, operational ownership, and sector/site reporting |
| `lifecycle` | `active`, `exception`, `decommissioning` | Keeps stale workloads and temporary exceptions visible |

## Workshop Output Checklist

By the end of a scope-design workshop, capture:

- The customer-owned authoritative inventory source and reconciliation owner.
- The CSW scope hierarchy for the selected framework.
- Required baseline labels and framework-specific labels.
- Initial values for regulated data, criticality, owner, and environment.
- Known gaps: unsupported workloads, missing connectors, uninstrumented OT,
  unmanaged SaaS, IAM-only controls, physical controls, or legal obligations.
- The first ADM / flow-search window and evidence export cadence.
- A named owner for label hygiene and exception review.

## Customer Conversation Prompt

The practical question is not "can CSW map to this framework?" It is:

> Which workloads, flows, owners, and labels must be correct before the
> mapping becomes evidence a customer can validate with their assessor?

Use this guide to answer that question before building dashboards or
collecting audit packets.
