# Cisco Secure Workload — BSI Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5)
## Technical Runbook | Cloud Service Providers and Cloud-Hosted Workloads Serving German Federal / Public-Sector Customers

**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue (C5), Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik / BSI). C5:2020 is the published catalogue at the time of writing.  
**Use Case:** Cloud workload segmentation evidence, operational security (OPS) evidence, communication security (KOS) evidence, identity & access management (IDM) at the workload-to-workload layer, asset management (AM) evidence, incident management (SIM) forensic input, and assessor evidence preparation

> **Framework version note.** This runbook references C5:2020. BSI may publish revisions; validate the catalogue version against the customer's assessment scope. C5 distinguishes between **Basic Criteria** and **Additional Criteria** (the latter expanding evidence requirements). This runbook references **C5 topic areas by name** and a few well-known area abbreviations (e.g. AM, IDM, KRY, OPS, KOS, SIM, BCM). Specific criterion numbering may vary across catalogue revisions — confirm against the version under assessment.
>
> **CSW UI navigation note.** Cisco does not yet publish C5-specific CSW UI navigation; framework-specific paths are on the product roadmap. This runbook describes CSW *capabilities* and the *evidence artifacts* they produce.

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers operating cloud-hosted workloads that serve German federal or public-sector customers, or any customer that contractually requires C5 evidence; CISO function, cloud operations lead, and the team preparing the C5 attestation (Type 1 or Type 2) report with an external auditor.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Can I evidence cloud-workload asset management (AM) at the workload layer?*
- *Can I evidence segmentation between cloud customer tenants and between cloud environments (KOS)?*
- *Can I evidence operational security controls — monitoring, vulnerability management, configuration baselines (OPS)?*
- *Can I evidence workload-to-workload access privileges aligned with the identity layer (IDM)?*
- *Can I produce forensic-quality evidence for security incident management (SIM)?*

**What you'll need.** Cloud asset inventory across all relevant cloud accounts / subscriptions, tenant separation model, customer scope agreements, vulnerability management process, configuration baseline definitions, incident management runbook, and the C5 assessor's evidence template.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping; 5–7 if you are designing and simulating policy; 9–10 if you are preparing the auditor evidence pack within the next quarter.

## 1. Overview

C5 is the BSI catalogue for cloud-service security. It is structured around topic areas (Bereiche), each containing multiple criteria. The catalogue is typically used as the basis of a C5 attestation report performed by an external auditor under ISAE 3000 / IDW PS 860, very similar in style to a SOC 2 Type 2 report.

CSW can support **technical evidence** for the workload-, network-, segmentation-, telemetry-, vulnerability-, and incident-related criteria of C5: Asset Management (AM), Identity and Access Management at the workload-to-workload layer (IDM), Operational Security (OPS), Communication Security (KOS), and Security Incident Management (SIM). CSW does **not** replace organisational, physical, contractual, supplier, or personnel controls — and it does not replace cryptography (KRY) or identity-lifecycle controls.

### C5 Topic Areas and CSW Relevance

| C5 topic area (Bereich) | CSW relevance |
|---|---|
| Organisation of Information Security (OIS) | Out of scope (governance) |
| Personnel (HR) | Out of scope |
| Asset Management (AM) | Workload inventory; scope + label evidence; reachability |
| Physical Security (PS) | Out of scope |
| Operations (OPS) | Continuous monitoring, vulnerability + reachability, configuration baseline |
| Identity and Access Management (IDM) | Workload-to-workload allowlist (complements identity layer) |
| Cryptography and Key Management (KRY) | Plaintext-flow detection on regulated paths (detection only) |
| Communication Security (KOS) | Workload-level segmentation; ADM-derived allowlist; policy workspace |
| Portability and Interoperability (PI) | Out of scope |
| Procurement, Development and Modification (DEV) | Out of scope for code-level controls; CSW shows reachability of dev / build paths |
| Control and Monitoring of Service Providers (SP) | Outbound flow visibility to service-provider endpoints |
| Security Incident Management (SIM) | Forensic flow + process telemetry |
| Business Continuity (BCM) | Approved flow baseline as one input to recoverability evidence |
| Compliance (COM) | Periodic evidence pack inputs |
| Investigation (INQ) | Forensic flow / process telemetry |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] CSW cluster provisioned
- [ ] Cloud accounts / subscriptions enumerated; CSW cloud connectors prepared
- [ ] Sensor compatibility verified for representative Linux / Windows cloud workloads
- [ ] Tenant separation model documented (single-tenant per customer? multi-tenant with logical isolation?)
- [ ] Stakeholders identified: CISO, Cloud Operations Lead, Auditor liaison, Service Provider Manager
- [ ] Evidence retention period agreed with the auditor (typically 12 months for Type 2)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor & Connector Deployment (Days 1–5)

- Connect all in-scope cloud accounts / subscriptions as read-only CSW cloud connectors
- Install software sensors on representative cloud workloads in monitoring mode
- Day-1 labels: `tenant`, `customer`, `environment`, `data_class`, `service_offering`, `owner`, `compliance=bsi-c5`
- Maintain a `cannot-instrument` register for managed PaaS / SaaS dependencies; this register is evidence
- Retain Phase-1 sensor inventory baseline

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope, Tenant Boundary, and Asset Management (Days 6–10) — supports AM, KOS

### 4.1 Suggested Scope Architecture

```
Root Scope
└── BSI-C5
    ├── Customer-Tenants
    │   ├── Tenant-A
    │   ├── Tenant-B
    │   └── Tenant-C
    ├── Shared-Infrastructure
    │   ├── Identity-Layer
    │   ├── Logging-Telemetry
    │   ├── Patch-Configuration
    │   └── Backup-Layer
    ├── Management-Plane
    │   ├── Operator-Jump-Hosts
    │   └── Admin-Consoles
    └── External-Service-Providers
```

### 4.2 Inventory Filters

```
Filter: Customer-Tenant-Membership
  - Tag (from cloud tags): tenant = <tenant-id>
  - Cloud account / subscription matches tenant assignment

Filter: Shared-Infrastructure-Candidates
  - Tag: service_offering = shared | platform
  - Reach: serves multiple tenants

Filter: Management-Plane-Candidates
  - Listening port: 22, 3389, 443 (admin endpoints)
  - Tag: purpose = management-plane
```

### 4.3 Labeling Strategy

| Label key | Example values | Why it matters for C5 |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant` | <tenant-id> | Anchors KOS tenant-separation evidence |
| `customer` | <customer-name> | Maps workloads to customer contractual scope |
| `environment` | production, staging, dev | Required for environment separation evidence |
| `data_class` | customer, internal, public | Data-handling evidence |
| `service_offering` | <offering-name>, shared, platform | Maps workloads to documented service offerings |
| `owner` | <named function> | Accountability |
| `compliance` | bsi-c5 | Filters CSW evidence to C5 scope |

Inventory + scope + label evidence = AM evidence at the workload layer.

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Application Dependency Mapping (Days 11–21)

Run ADM for each scope across a 2-week-minimum window. Document, per cluster:

| Question | C5 topic area |
|---|---|
| Do Tenant-A workloads ever reach Tenant-B workloads? | KOS (tenant separation) |
| Are flows from Management-Plane into Customer-Tenants restricted to documented admin paths? | IDM (privileged access) |
| Are database flows plaintext? | KRY (detection) |
| Which Customer-Tenants reach External-Service-Providers? | SP (sub-service-provider control) |
| Are unexpected lateral flows present inside Shared-Infrastructure? | OPS / SIM |

Use ADM to confirm / correct `tenant`, `service_offering`, and `data_class` labels.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Development (Days 22–35) — supports KOS, IDM, OPS

### 6.1 C5-Aligned Policy Framework

**Absolute policies (tenant separation; the heart of KOS for multi-tenant CSPs):**

```
DENY  Tenant-A                  → Tenant-B                       (no cross-tenant flow)
DENY  Tenant-B                  → Tenant-A                       (no cross-tenant flow)
DENY  Customer-Tenants          → Internet                       (no direct internet egress unless service-offering-defined)
DENY  Corporate-IT              → Customer-Tenants               (admin only via Management-Plane)
```

**Allowlist policies (least privilege):**

```
ALLOW Tenant-A-Channel          → Tenant-A-DB                    tcp/<db-port-tls>
ALLOW Customer-Tenants          → Shared-Infrastructure          tcp/443 (platform services only)
ALLOW Operator-Jump-Hosts       → Customer-Tenants               tcp/22, tcp/3389
ALLOW Customer-Tenants          → Logging-Telemetry              tcp/443
```

**Catch-all:**

```
LOG   Any                       → Customer-Tenants               (unmatched inbound)
LOG   Customer-Tenants          → Any                            (unmatched outbound)
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Lifecycle

| Phase | Mode | Duration | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2 weeks | Validate against live traffic |
| 2 | Enforcement of cross-tenant denies | 1 week | The most critical KOS rule first |
| 3 | Full Enforcement | Ongoing | Workload allowlist enforced; monthly exception review |

Workspace snapshots = KOS / IDM / OPS control-implementation evidence.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Topic Mapping with CSW Evidence

| C5 topic area | What CSW produces | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| AM | Workload inventory; scope + label export | Asset and classification evidence |
| IDM | Policy workspace + enforcement / violation log | Workload-to-workload privilege evidence (complements identity layer) |
| KRY | Plaintext-flow detection | Detection input only |
| OPS | Continuous flow / process telemetry; vulnerability + reachability; configuration drift on policy | Operational security evidence |
| KOS | Policy workspace; ADM-derived allowlist; observed flows | Communication security / tenant separation |
| SP | Outbound flow summary to service-provider endpoints | Sub-service-provider monitoring evidence |
| SIM | Flow + process search across the incident window | Forensic timeline |
| BCM | Approved flow baseline for recovery validation | Recoverability input |
| COM | Periodic evidence pack (Section 10.1) | Auditor work-paper input |
| INQ | Flow + process search | Investigation evidence |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability & Risk Management (OPS)

Reachability-weighted prioritisation:

```
Priority 1: Critical CVE on Customer-Tenants with inbound reachability
Priority 2: Critical CVE on Shared-Infrastructure with reach into Customer-Tenants
Priority 3: Critical CVE on Management-Plane workloads
```

Document compensating controls in the policy workspace exception register; this register is itself evidence under OPS (vulnerability and risk management).

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring & Alerting (OPS / SIM)

| Alert | Trigger | C5 topic |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-tenant attempt | Tenant-A → Tenant-B (any flow) | KOS |
| Management-Plane → Customer-Tenant outside change window | Operator-Jump-Hosts → Customer-Tenants outside an authorised change window | IDM / OPS |
| External egress from Customer-Tenants | Customer-Tenants → external endpoint not in allow-list | SP / KOS |
| Plaintext on regulated path | HTTP / unencrypted DB protocol from Customer-Tenants | KRY (detection) |
| Policy violation | Enforced policy block triggered | KOS / OPS |
| Sensor offline | Agent stops reporting | Evidence integrity |

### 9.2 Forensic Telemetry

Per incident, retain:

- Flow log scoped to affected workload(s) and time window (with process context)
- Process search output
- Policy workspace state at the time of the incident
- Vulnerability snapshot for the affected workload(s)
- Customer / tenant identification of the affected workload(s) for breach-notification scoping (decision is governance, not automated)

---

## 10. Reporting & Evidence Collection

### 10.1 Evidence per Audit Cycle (continuous; auditor sample window typically 12 months for Type 2)

| Evidence item | CSW source area | C5 topic |
|---|---|---|
| Workload inventory | Inventory export | AM |
| Scope + label membership | Scope membership export | AM / KOS |
| Approved vs. observed flows | ADM workspace export | KOS / OPS |
| Policy workspace snapshot | Policy workspace export | KOS / IDM |
| Policy enforcement / violations | Policy analysis output | KOS / IDM / OPS |
| Vulnerability + reachability | Vulnerability report scoped to BSI-C5 | OPS |
| Cross-tenant deny evidence | Policy workspace + violation log of cross-tenant attempts | KOS |
| External service-provider egress | Flow search to External-Service-Providers | SP |
| Incident timeline samples | Flow + process search | SIM / INQ |
| Exception register | Policy workspace exceptions list | OPS (risk acceptance) |

### 10.2 Ongoing Compliance Posture

- **Monthly:** scope / inventory hygiene; tenant boundary review
- **Quarterly:** policy workspace review; refresh evidence pack 10.1
- **Annually:** independent walk-through with the C5 auditor; refresh assumptions and baselines
- **Continuously:** policy drift detection; ADM re-run every 90 days

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Treating CSW evidence as the full C5 attestation | C5 covers organisational, physical, supplier, and personnel controls outside CSW's scope |
| Tenant labels missing or inconsistent | Reconcile customer / tenant register ↔ CSW labels monthly; tenant boundary is the most important KOS evidence |
| Cross-tenant flows discovered late in the audit | Cross-tenant deny should be the very first enforcement rule |
| `service_offering` not aligned with the contracted offering definitions | Map service offerings 1:1 to scope branches; this is what the auditor will sample against |
| Plaintext assumed by port | Confirm by process + observed handshake |
| Treating SP egress as safe because the destination is "well-known" | All service-provider egress should be enumerated, reconciled to the SP register, and monitored |
