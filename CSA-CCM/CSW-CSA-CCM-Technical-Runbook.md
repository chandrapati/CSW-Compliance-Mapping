# Cisco Secure Workload — CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4.0 (CCM)
## Technical Runbook | Multicloud and Hybrid Workload Security

**Version:** 1.0  
**Standard:** CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0  
**Use Case:** CCM-based assessments (including CSA STAR readiness), multicloud / hybrid IaaS and PaaS, shared responsibility alignment with ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, and SOC 2 mappings

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Cloud security architects, GRC teams using CSA CCM for gap analysis or STAR certification preparation, and operations teams implementing compensating technical controls on workloads (VMs, containers, and connected services) spanning public cloud and data center.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *For **IAM** and **IVS** (segmentation), can I show application-aware, deny-by-default network enforcement with identity context—not only cloud perimeter controls?*
- *For **AIS** (application and interface security), can I map real dependencies between tiers and APIs before locking interfaces?*
- *For **DSP** (data security and privacy lifecycle), can I document and control flows to sensitive tiers and demonstrate isolation between workloads with different data classes?*
- *For **LOG** (logging and monitoring), can I ship workload-level flow and process telemetry into the enterprise SIEM with retention suitable for investigations?*
- *For **TVM**, can I prioritize CVE remediation using exposure and east-west reachability, not only scanner output?*
- *For **BCR** and **CCC**, how does CSW support *validation* of recovery and change baselines without replacing formal BCM or ITSM?*

**What you'll need.** A CCM control scope (which domains apply to which service layers per CSA shared responsibility), cloud account inventory, tagging standards, SIEM onboarding runbooks, and agreement on **in-scope workloads** (subscriptions, VPCs/VNets, projects).

**Where to start.** Section 2 for domain-to-capability orientation; sections 3–6 for deployment; sections 7–9 for policy and evidence aligned to **IVS**, **LOG**, **IAM**, **AIS**, and **DSP**; section 12 when packaging STAR or customer audit artifacts.

## 1. Overview

The CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4.0 organizes **197 control objectives** across **17 domains**. CCM is deliberately **cloud-neutral** and is widely used to **harmonize** assessments with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST publications, PCI DSS, CIS Controls, and other frameworks—particularly in **CSA STAR** self-assessment and third-party certification programs.

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) provides **workload-centric** visibility, micro-segmentation, vulnerability exposure analytics, and forensic telemetry. It addresses technical aspects of several CCM domains while remaining **out of scope** for purely organizational or HR-driven domains (notably parts of **HRS**). CSW complements CSP-native controls (security groups, WAF, CSPM, IAM policies) rather than replacing them.

### 1.1 CCM v4 Domains and CSW Relevance

| Domain | Title | CSW relevance |
|---|---|---|
| A&A | Audit & Assurance | Supporting — artifacts for control testing samples; CSW is not the internal audit function |
| AIS | Application & Interface Security | **Direct** — dependency mapping, process-level visibility, constrained interfaces via policy |
| BCR | Business Continuity Management & Operational Resilience | Supporting — telemetry baselines and snapshots help validate recovered connectivity; BCM program remains organizational |
| CCC | Change Control & Configuration Management | **Direct** — software inventory changes, ADM drift versus approved flows |
| CEK | Cryptography, Encryption & Key Management | Supporting — detect cleartext paths; key vault operations are outside CSW |
| DCS | Datacenter Security | Limited — logical segmentation and workload monitoring where agents/connectors deploy; physical DC security is out of scope |
| DSP | Data Security & Privacy Lifecycle Management | **Direct** — data-flow mapping between tiers; isolation of sensitive workloads |
| GRC | Governance, Risk & Compliance | Supporting — continuous monitoring dashboards, exportable metrics for control KPIs |
| HRS | Human Resources | **Out of scope** — screening, training records, personnel policies |
| IAM | Identity & Access Management | **Direct (technical)** — identity-aware segmentation integrated with enterprise identity context where supported; IAM lifecycle is IAM-team owned |
| IPY | Interoperability & Portability | Out of scope — architectural portability decisions |
| IVS | Infrastructure & Virtualization Security | **Direct** — micro-segmentation, isolation, cloud/on-prem workload visibility |
| LOG | Logging and Monitoring | **Direct** — flow + process telemetry; SIEM integration |
| SEF | Security Incident Management, E-Discovery, & Cloud Forensics | **Supporting (evidence)** — incident timelines, scope of lateral movement |
| STA | Supply Chain Management, Transparency, and Accountability | Limited — workload artifact visibility; procurement SCRM is organizational |
| TVM | Threat & Vulnerability Management | **Direct** — CVE inventory, prioritization with reachability / EPSS-style context if available |
| UEM | Universal Endpoint Management | Limited — server/workload focus; mobile UEM is typically separate tooling |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] CSW tenancy matches data residency and contractual constraints for assessed cloud regions.
- [ ] All **in-scope** cloud accounts / subscriptions registered; read-only discovery roles documented in CCM evidence (IAM policies attached to CCM CCC / IAM folders).
- [ ] Network path from workloads and connectors to CSW management plane (typically HTTPS) allowed.
- [ ] Tag strategy defined: `environment`, `data_class`, `service_tier`, `ccm_scope`, `star_service_id`.
- [ ] Stakeholders: cloud platform engineering, security architecture, GRC lead, SOC.
- [ ] Initial posture: **monitoring / simulation** before production enforcement.

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor and Connector Deployment (Days 1–7)

### 3.1 IaaS / VM-Based Workloads

```bash
# Linux agent example (package names vary by distro — use Cisco-supplied packages for your OS)
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm
sudo systemctl enable --now tet-engine || sudo systemctl enable --now csw-agent
```

Windows: deploy via approved packaging (SCCM / Intune / golden image) with automatic startup verification.

### 3.2 Cloud Connectors (AWS / Azure / GCP)

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Register each cloud account used by in-scope services
  → Map resource tags → CSW labels (e.g., Confidentiality=HIGH → DSP-High scope)
  → Enable optional flow telemetry sources supported for your CSP (where used for correlation)
```

### 3.3 Health Checks

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents / Connectors
  → All production tier assets reporting
  → Version compliance with golden image standard (feeds CCC evidence)
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope, Zones, and Data-Flow Architecture (Days 5–14)

### 4.1 Recommended Logical Model (Maps to DSP / IVS)

```
Cloud-Org Root
├── Prod-Payment / Regulated
│   ├── App
│   ├── Data
│   └── Integration
├── Prod-General
├── Shared-Services (SIEM, IdP read replicas, CI runners — classify carefully)
└── Sandbox / Non-Prod (separate policy workspace from prod)
```

### 4.2 Labeling for STAR / CCM Traceability

| Label | Example | Maps to evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `ccm_domain_focus` | `IVS,LOG,DSP` | Control scoping notes in STAR file |
| `data_class` | `pci`, `pii`, `confidential`, `public` | DSP segmentation narratives |
| `pci_in_scope` | `true/false` | When PCI DSS overlays apply |
| `star_service` | `SVC-042` | STAR service catalogue reference |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility, ADM Baseline, and TVM (Days 10–35)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (AIS / DSP)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Workspace: CCM-ADM-<BusinessService>-<Period>
  → Scope: in-scope prod tiers for the STAR service
  → Minimum duration: 14 days (capture batch / billing cycles)
  → Capture process + user context for interface inventory (AIS)
```

**AIS-focused review prompts:**

| Question | CCM tie-in |
|---|---|
| Which binaries initiate egress to third-party APIs? | AIS — interface inventory |
| Which internal services accept unauthenticated connections? | AIS / IAM |
| Are admin interfaces exposed laterally beyond operator subnets? | IVS / IAM |

### 5.2 TVM — Exposure and Reachability (TVM)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Filter: internet-adjacent AND path to regulated data tier in ADM
  → Export: CVE list with workload ID, CVSS, fix status linkage
```

Use exports as **inputs** to CCM TVM control narratives, not as the sole source of truth for patch SLAs.

### 5.3 Baseline Snapshots for BCR / CCC Validation

- Export ADM graph and policy workspace after each **approved release** → store as **configuration baseline artifacts** (CCC).
- After DR tests, compare connectivity patterns (counts, critical paths) against pre-event baseline → attach summary to BCR test report.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design — IVS, IAM, DSP (Days 25–45)

### 6.1 Policy Workspace Structure

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Workspace: STAR-<Service>-Prod-Enforce
  → Scope labels: data_class in (pci, pii, confidential)
  → Import ADM recommendations
  → Rule metadata: owner, ticket, review_date, ccm_control_reference (free text field if available)
```

### 6.2 **IVS-09** (Network Segmentation / Security) — Pattern

CCM **IVS-09** objectives center on network segmentation appropriate to sensitivity. At the workload layer:

```
# Illustrative policy pattern — replace with ADM-derived peers
DEFAULT: DENY east-west not explicitly approved within Prod-Payment
ALLOW:   Payment-App → Payment-DB  [least-privilege ports only]
ALLOW:   Payment-App → Shared-KMS-Endpoint  [443 — if architecture uses cloud KMS]
DENY:    Prod-General → Prod-Payment (all ports) except documented break-glass
LOG+ALERT: First-seen lateral connection inside Prod-Payment
```

### 6.3 IAM Integration (Technical Enforcement Dimension)

- Align CSW scopes with **enterprise identity segmentation** (e.g., admin SGs, PIM roles). CSW rules should reference **who is allowed to originate** admin flows (jump boxes) rather than opening broad management subnets.

### 6.4 DSP — Data Flow Boundaries

- Enforce **tier separation** (presentation / application / data).
- Create **explicit rules** for backup, replication, and SIEM egress so data movement is **expected and logged**.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Enforcement Progression and Change Discipline

| Stage | Objective | CCC / GRC note |
|---|---|---|
| Simulation | Tune alerts; document false positives | Link to change tickets |
| Phased enforcement | Start with identifiable bad paths (open internet from data tier) | Record CAB approvals |
| Full enforcement | Default deny + signed allow-list | Control owner sign-off stored with STAR evidence |

**Change detection (CCC):** any net-new listening port or unexpected peer cluster observed post-release should trigger **ADM diff review** before permanent allow-list update.

---

## 8. Phase 6 — LOG / SEF: Monitoring, SIEM, and Forensics

### 8.1 LOG Domain — Telemetry to SIEM

```
CSW UI → Settings / Integrations (per product)
  → Configure syslog / webhook / vendor connector to SIEM
  → Map severity to SOC playbooks
```

Retain mapping documentation: field list, filter rules, retention period, and sampling methodology (supports **A&A** evidence requests).

### 8.2 SEF — Incident Evidence

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search + Process Search
  → Narrow by workload scope label star_service=<id>
  → Export incident package with UTC timestamps and policy action
```

Pair CSW exports with CSP CloudTrail / Azure Activity Log where authorities require **control-plane** and **data-plane** correlation.

---

## 9. Domain-to-Control Mapping Table (Summary)

The CSA CCM enumerates objectives with codes (e.g., **AIS-01**, **IVS-09**). Exact numbering should be cited from your official **CCM v4** spreadsheet or STAR tool export. This table summarizes **domain-level** expectations versus CSW.

| CCM domain | Representative objectives (examples) | CSW capability | Evidence examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| AIS | Secure SDLC interfaces; API protections | ADM dependency map; deny unexpected service bindings | ADM export; list of approved listeners per tier |
| BCR | Resilience testing; recovery procedures | Pre/post DR ADM/policy diff; availability of telemetry during tests | Test report attachment with connectivity baselines |
| CCC | Change / config management | Drift detection; inventory deltas | Quarterly diff report; CAB ticket linkage |
| DSP | Data classification handling; residency patterns (as applicable) | Segmentation between classes; monitored egress | Policy workspace + DSP data-flow diagram |
| GRC | Metrics, improvement | Dashboards of policy violations, sensor coverage % | Monthly KPI export to GRC tool |
| HRS | Personnel practices | *Not applicable to CSW* | Narrative stating HR controls separate |
| IAM | Access enforcement | Identity-aware segmentation; admin path controls | Jump-host-only allow rules with logs |
| IVS | Host / virtualization / network security incl. **IVS-09** | Micro-segmentation; cloud VM inventory | Enforcement report by VPC/VNet |
| LOG | Central logging & monitoring | Flow/process telemetry; SIEM feed health | Connector uptime; sample events |
| SEF | Incident handling & forensics | Timeline reconstruction; process trees | Incident export bundle |
| TVM | Vuln management | CVE + exposure context | Risk-ranked export |

---

## 10. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover for CCM

- **HRS** end-to-end (background checks, training completion records).
- **Purely contractual / legal** STAR attestations without technical instrumentation.
- **Cloud control plane** configuration (unless reported via complementary integrations): IAM role design, KMS policy, bucket ACLs—CSW informs workload behavior but does not replace CSP IAM review.
- **Endpoint mobility / UEM** UES fleets unless those endpoints carry CSW agents and are in scope.
- **Customer responsibilities** mis-labeled as provider responsibilities under shared responsibility—always map CCM rows to the correct party before claiming implementation.

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| STAR scope drift — workloads appear outside labelled VPCs/VNets | Weekly inventory reconcile; enforce tag inheritance at subscription/project |
| CCM row claimed without shared-responsibility check | Mark customer vs. CSP for each objective; attach responsibility matrix |
| IVS policies only at cloud edge | Add east-west segmentation on critical tiers; document defense-in-depth |
| SIEM integration skipped | Treat LOG domain as failed until centralized retention is proven |
| Non-prod changes promoted without ADM diff | Re-baseline ADM after each release; CAB blocks rule changes without diff |
| Over-alerting → SOC disables feeds | Tune in simulation; severity mapping before enforcement |

---

## 12. Audit Preparation and Evidence Export (STAR / Customer Audit)

### 12.1 Suggested Evidence Package by Domain Focus

| CCM domain focus | Include in package |
|---|---|
| IVS / IAM / DSP | Policy PDF or JSON export + ADM snapshot + scope inventory CSV |
| LOG | SIEM schema mapping + 90-day retention attestation + sample alerts |
| TVM | Vulnerability export + remediation ticket cross-reference |
| AIS | Interface inventory derived from ADM clusters + pen test linkage if performed |
| GRC | Coverage metrics (% agents healthy, % workloads in-scope) trend line |

### 12.2 Automation Snippet (Inventory Pull)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Illustrative — substitute your approved API client / secrets manager paths.
OUTDIR="./ccm_evidence_$(date -u +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "${OUTDIR}"
# Example placeholders:
# csw-cli inventory export --scope CCM-STAR-SVC042 --output "${OUTDIR}/inventory.csv"
# csw-cli policy export --workspace STAR-SVC042-PROD --output "${OUTDIR}/policy.json"
echo "Package ${OUTDIR} and upload to secure evidence store per GRC policy."
```

## Appendix A — CCM v4 and Other Frameworks

CSA publishes **Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)** and mapping matrices correlating CCM to **ISO/IEC 27001**, **NIST**, **PCI DSS**, and others. Use those mappings to avoid duplicate work: a single CSW flow-enforcement narrative may satisfy overlapping rows **when** scope and responsibilities match.
