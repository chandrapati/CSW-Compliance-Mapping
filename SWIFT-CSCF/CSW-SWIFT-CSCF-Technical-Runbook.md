# Cisco Secure Workload — SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF)
## Technical Runbook | Financial Messaging & SWIFT Secure Zone Accounts

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)  
**Framework Reference:** SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF) v2024

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Institutions that participate in the SWIFT network,
their messaging interface operators, security teams preparing for the
SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP) attestation or independent
assessment, and infrastructure teams responsible for the **SWIFT secure
zone** architecture.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Can I prove the SWIFT secure zone is logically isolated from general
  corporate IT and that policy enforcement matches the documented
  connection matrix?* (CSCF 1.1, 2.1)
- *Can I demonstrate that workloads in the secure zone cannot initiate
  direct paths to the public Internet at the workload enforcement
  layer?* (CSCF 1.4)
- *When an operator uses a privileged path, can I show *which*
  processes and flows were involved—not only that an account logged in?*
  (CSCF 1.2, 5.1)
- *Can I detect and block or alert on cleartext operator protocols inside
  the zone if they appear?* (CSCF 2.6)
- *For CSP evidence windows, what continuous artifacts complement my AV,
  SIEM, and IR playbooks at the workload tier?* (CSCF 6.1, 6.4, 7.1)

**What you'll need.** Your current SWIFT architecture classification
(connectivity and component model per SWIFT guidance), the official CSCF
v2024 control matrix for your **architecture type** (mandatory vs
advisory applicability), network diagrams, a list of SWIFT-related
components (SMC, connectors, gateways, HSM adjacency, jump hosts), and
either CSW already deployed or scope decisions for deployment.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 for executive alignment; 3–6 to deploy
and baseline; 7 for control mapping and evidence; 8–9 for boundaries
and audit preparation; Appendix A to reconcile **Mandatory (M)** vs
**Advisory (A)** labels with your SWIFT architecture row.

## 1. Overview

SWIFT CSCF v2024 prescribes security controls for users of the SWIFT
network. Technical evidence is only one layer: organizational policies,
third-party assurance, and physical/logical SWIFT architecture design
remain authoritative. **Cisco Secure Workload (CSW)** strengthens the
technical story where **workload visibility, microsegmentation,
vulnerability–reachability context, and forensic telemetry** apply—especially
for the **SWIFT secure zone** and tightly coupled components.

CSW does **not** replace SWIFT connectors, VPNs, bastion patterns, HSMs,
or mandated CSP assessments; it complements them with **continuous
workload-level enforcement and evidence**.

### 1.1 CSCF v2024 Control Groupings vs CSW (Summary)

| CSCF Group (Illustrative) | Representative Themes | Relevant CSW Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Secure Environment | Zone protection, privileged access, internet restriction | Microsegmentation, egress enforcement, privileged-flow visibility |
| 2 — Restrict Internet Access & Zone Defences | Internal flows, session confidentiality | Flow telemetry, cleartext protocol detection/blocking |
| 3 — Reduce Attack Surface & Vulnerability | Hardening, patching cadence (org-led) | CVE exposure + reachability, policy compensating controls |
| 4 — Physical Security | Credentials, passwords (largely org/IdP) | **Mostly out of scope** for CSW (see Section 8) |
| 5 — Manage Identities & Logical Access | Logical access, separation of duties | Identity-aware policy where integrated; scope/label-based segmentation |
| 6 — Detect & Respond & Recover | Malware, logging, IR | Process anomaly signals, flow/process export, forensics |
| 7 — Cyber Incident & Business Continuity | IR planning, resilience | Timelines from flow/process history; policy snapshots |

> **Note on Mandatory vs Advisory:** SWIFT labels each control **Mandatory (M)**,
> **Advisory (A)**, or **Not Applicable (N/A)** depending on your institution’s
> **architecture type** in the official CSCF matrix. Every control row in Section 7
> includes a **typical** M/A hint; **always reconcile** against your attestation
> pack and official v2024 documentation.

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW sensors into the SWIFT environment:

- [ ] **Architecture type** confirmed and documented (per SWIFT CSCF / connectivity model)
- [ ] **SWIFT secure zone** CIDRs, VLANs, cloud subnets, and management enclaves identified
- [ ] **Data-flow baseline** available or planned (known SMC, middleware, HSM clients, monitoring)
- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-prem) provisioned; **443 outbound** from workloads approved
- [ ] Linux/Windows sensor compatibility verified for all **in-zone** targets
- [ ] Cloud connectors configured if zone spans **AWS / Azure / GCP**
- [ ] Change windows approved; **enforcement** explicitly *not* enabled Day 1
- [ ] Stakeholders engaged: CISO, SWIFT Coordinator, Network Ops, SOC/IR, Internal Audit
- [ ] **Segregation of duties:** CSW admin accounts are not shared with SWIFT operators

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 Secure Zone Workloads (On-Premises)

**Install software sensors on servers and operator jump systems in scope:**

```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Ubuntu) — example
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm    # RHEL/CentOS family
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb     # Debian/Ubuntu

# Verify agent health
systemctl status csw-agent || systemctl status tetration-agent
```

**Baseline posture:**

| Setting | Initial Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement | **Monitoring / Simulation only** | Prevent production messaging disruption |
| Flow + process collection | **Enabled** | CSP evidence and IR timelines |
| Labels | `compliance:swift`, `zone:swift-secure` | Scope accuracy |

### 3.2 Cloud Workloads (if applicable)

Use **sensors on instances** and/or **cloud connectors** for inventory and flow context:

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Add AWS / Azure / GCP connector
  → Least-privilege IAM / service principal
  → Enable flow log ingestion where used for the secure zone
```

### 3.3 Sensor Validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Filter: label zone=swift-secure (or equivalent)
  → Validate "Active" telemetry for every production messaging component
  → Confirm agent version currency (document for audit evidence)
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope Design & Inventory (Days 6–12)

### 4.1 Recommended CSW Scope Hierarchy (SWIFT Secure Zone)

```
Root Scope
└── SWIFT-Program
    ├── SWIFT-Secure-Zone (strict enforcement target)
    │   ├── Messaging-Interfaces (SMC / middleware / connectors per your architecture)
    │   ├── Proxy-Gateway-Layer (if present)
    │   ├── Operator-Jump-Hosts
    │   └── Local-Logging-Forwarders
    ├── SWIFT-Adjacent (controlled interfaces only)
    │   ├── SIEM-Collectors (east-west allowlist only)
    │   ├── Enterprise-AD-LDAP-Replicas (if architecture requires — justify narrowly)
    │   └── Backup-Control-Plane (if in connector path)
    └── Corporate-IT (out of SWIFT zone — default deny from zone)
```

### 4.2 Discovery Filters (Examples)

Create saved inventory queries to catch drift:

```
Filter: SWIFT-Candidate-Processes
  - Process name contains: (align to YOUR stack — e.g. smc, swift, mq, xml gateway binaries)
  - Listening ports: (document your standard listener map — e.g. messaging middleware)

Filter: Privileged-Operations
  - User context in [operator groups] AND process in [shells, remote admin tools]
```

### 4.3 Labelling Strategy

| Label Key | Example Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `zone` | swift-secure, adjacent, corporate | Boundary for policy |
| `compliance` | swift-cscf | Reporting filters |
| `role` | smc, gateway, jump, logging | Rule targeting |
| `env` | production, dr | Change control |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility, Baseline & ADM (Days 10–28)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)

ADM produces the **live internal data-flow graph** required to validate
CSCF **internal flow** expectations and to author least-privilege rules.

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → New Workspace
  → Name: "SWIFT-CSCF-ADM-2026"
  → Scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone (+ Adjacent if needed for cross-scope flows)
  → Time Window: minimum 2–4 weeks (cover end-of-month / batch cycles)
  → Enable process context (and user context where available)
```

### 5.2 Baseline Review Questions (CSCF-Oriented)

| Question | CSCF Tie-In |
|---|---|
| Which flows exit the secure zone, and to exactly which adjacencies? | 1.1, 2.1 |
| Are there any unexpected internet-bound egress attempts from zone members? | 1.4 |
| Do operator sessions traverse cleartext protocols internally? | 2.6 |
| Which hosts initiate administrative tooling sessions inbound to SMC/gateway tiers? | 1.2, 5.1 |

### 5.3 Export for Architecture Evidence

Export ADM clusters and edge lists after stabilisation:

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Open workspace → Export (per product UI) cluster + edge summaries
```

Store exports with **version, time window, and scope** metadata for CSP
folders.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design & Enforcement (Days 22–45)

### 6.1 Policy Workspace

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → New Workspace: "SWIFT-CSCF-Enforcement"
  → Scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
  → Import ADM-suggested policies → refine to match **documented** connection matrix
  → Mode: Simulation → Enforcement (staged)
```

### 6.2 Illustrative Policy Patterns (YAML-Style Snippets)

> Adapt field names to your CSW release; treat these as **logical** patterns.

**Default posture — deny SWIFT secure zone to Internet at workload layer:**

```yaml
# Logical illustration — SWIFT-Secure-Zone → Internet egress denial
rules:
  - name: SWIFT-Zone-Deny-Internet-Egress
    action: DENY
    source:
      scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
    destination:
      internet: true
    layer: workload
    rationale: "CSCF 1.4 — restriction of internet access (defence in depth)"
```

**Allow only approved east–west dependencies (replace ports with your architecture):**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: SWIFT-Allow-Approved-Dependencies
    action: ALLOW
    source:
      scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
    destination:
      scope: SWIFT-Adjacent
    services:
      - protocol: TCP
        ports: [443, 8443, <your-messaging-ports>]
```

**Privileged operator path — alert-first, then enforce in tranches:**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Operator-Jump-To-SMC-Allowlist
    action: ALLOW
    source:
      labels:
        role: jump
    destination:
      labels:
        role: smc
    services:
      - protocol: TCP
        ports: [<admin-ports>]
```

**Cleartext detection (Telnet/FTP examples — extend to other plaintext stacks):**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: Block-Cleartext-Inside-Secure-Zone
    action: DENY  # or ALERT-only during early simulation
    source:
      scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
    destination:
      scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
    application:
      protocol_detect: [telnet, ftp]
```

### 6.3 Enforcement Progression

| Stage | Mode | Duration | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Simulation | ≥2 weeks | Validate messaging + batch; capture false positives |
| B | **Selective DENY** (internet egress) | 1–2 weeks | Prove 1.4-style controls without touching core east-west |
| C | Full allowlist + default deny | Ongoing | Formal least privilege |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Control-by-Control Mapping (CSCF v2024)

> **M/A column:** **M** = typically **Mandatory**, **A** = typically **Advisory**
> for many user architectures in public CSCF summaries. **Confirm against your
> official v2024 matrix row** (architecture-dependent).

| CSCF Ref | Title (Short) | Typical M/A* | CSW Capability | Evidence Produced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | SWIFT environment protection | M | Microsegmentation of secure zone; deny unapproved cross-zone paths; ADM-backed allowlists | Policy workspace export; simulation vs enforcement reports; **scope membership** exports |
| 1.2 | OS privileged account control | M | **Process + flow visibility** for privileged sessions; anomaly alerts on new admin paths | Flow search with **process + user context**; alerts on disallowed admin stacks |
| 1.4 | Restriction of internet access | M | Explicit **DENY secure-zone → Internet** at workload layer; egress attempt visibility | Block counters / violation logs; flow reports showing no successful egress (or documented exceptions) |
| 2.1 | Internal data flow security | A/M† | **ADM + flow telemetry** for intra-zone and zone-to-adjacency conversations | ADM exports; **edge list** tagged by time window; diff between quarters |
| 2.6 | Operator session confidentiality | M | **Plaintext protocol detection** (e.g., Telnet/FTP) and blocking/alerts; enforce TLS-only paths where architecturally valid | Protocol-based rule hits; remediation tickets; pre/post flow captures |
| 4.1 | Password policy | M | **Out of scope** — IdP / directory / OS password controls (see Section 8) | Boundary statement + pointer to directory audit |
| 5.1 | Logical access control | M | **Identity-aware policy** (where integrated) + strict **role/label-scoped** rules for operator entry points | Rule sets tied to jump/SMC roles; access-path flow history |
| 6.1 | Malware protection | M | **Process anomaly** detection; execution lineage; complementary to AV/EDR | Anomaly timelines; correlations with AV alerts (operational narrative) |
| 6.4 | Logging & monitoring | M | Continuous **flow + process** telemetry; export to **SIEM** via product integrations or scheduled exports | Sensor uptime reports; export samples; SOC runbook references |
| 7.1 | Cyber incident response planning | M | **Forensic reconstruction** using historical flows/processes; policy snapshot/versioning for change control | Incident-window exports; before/after policy diffs; analyst query audit trail |

† **2.1** applicability (M vs A) is architecture-dependent in CSCF—verify your matrix.

\* **Mandatory/Advisory** classifications **must** be taken from the official SWIFT CSCF
v2024 documentation for your institution’s architecture; the M/A hints here support
runbook navigation only.

### 7.1 Additional CSCF Controls (Illustrative Technical Touchpoints)

| CSCF Area | Typical M/A | CSW-Relevant Angle | Evidence Hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.x / 3.x System hardening & vulnerability | Mixed | **CVE + reachability** prioritisation; narrow allow rules as compensating controls while patching | Vulnerability scoped reports; policy exception records |
| 6.x Detection sub-controls | Mixed | Workload segmentation blocks; east-west alerts | Alert exports; MTTD/MTTR narrative support |

---

## 8. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover

Be explicit with assessors to avoid **over-claiming**:

| Topic | Boundary |
|---|---|
| **SWIFT contractual & organizational CSP** | CSW does not complete the annual attestation or independent assessment for you. |
| **Architecture design approvals** | Physical/logical SWIFT architecture choices, VPNs, HW security modules, and connector placement remain **outside** CSW. |
| **Password / MFA / account lifecycle** | Directory controls, MFA enforcement, password length/history (**e.g., CSCF 4.1**) are **IdP/OS** responsibilities. |
| **Log tamper protection & retention law** | CSW generates telemetry; **log integrity, WORM storage, legal hold**, and contractual retention are SIEM/ops/legal domains. |
| **Malware efficacy** | CSW complements **AV/EDR** but does not replace signature/engine coverage or host isolation products. |
| **Patch installation** | CSW informs risk; **change execution** is IT operations. |
| **People & process controls** | Training, background checks, vendor SLAs, and IR tabletop governance remain organizational. |

---

## 9. Audit Preparation & Evidence Export

### 9.1 Recommended Quarterly Evidence Pack (CSW Portions)

| Evidence Item | CSW Source | Maps To (Examples) |
|---|---|---|
| Secure-zone **inventory** snapshot | Manage → Inventory / Agents | 1.1, 5.1 |
| **Policy workspace** export + version | Defend → Segmentation | 1.1, 1.4, 2.1, 5.1 |
| **Simulation vs enforcement** history | Policy analysis / audit | 1.4, 2.1 |
| **ADM** graph export (time-bounded) | Investigate → ADM | 2.1 |
| **Flow search** export (representative samples) | Investigate → Flow Search | 2.1, 6.4, 7.1 |
| **Violation / block** statistics | Alerts / policy hits | 1.4, 6.4 |
| **Vulnerability exposure** report (zone scoped) | Investigate → Vulnerability | 3.x hardening narrative |
| Agent **coverage & health** dashboard | Operations views | 6.4 |

### 9.2 Bash-Oriented Export Patterns (Examples)

When APIs/CLI are available in your deployment, wrap repeatable exports:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Illustrative — replace with your CSW API/CLI equivalents
set -euo pipefail
QUARTER="2026Q2"
SCOPE="SWIFT-Secure-Zone"
OUTDIR="./swift_csp_evidence_${QUARTER}"

mkdir -p "${OUTDIR}"
# pseudo-calls — implement using your supported automation
# csw inventory export --scope "${SCOPE}" > "${OUTDIR}/inventory.json"
# csw policy export --workspace SWIFT-CSCF-Enforcement > "${OUTDIR}/policies.json"
# csw adm export --workspace SWIFT-CSCF-ADM-2026 > "${OUTDIR}/adm-edges.csv"

echo "Package ${OUTDIR} with cryptographic hash manifest for audit chain of custody."
sha256sum "${OUTDIR}"/* > "${OUTDIR}/SHA256SUMS.txt"
```

### 9.3 Incident Response Evidence Collection

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → Time range: IR window (UTC-documented)
  → Source/Destination: affected workload identities
  → Export: CSV/JSON + process metadata

CSW UI → Investigate → Process Search
  → Scope: SWIFT-Secure-Zone
  → Parent/child lineage for suspicious execution
```

Retain exports under your **records management** policy; correlate with
tickets, timelines, and third-party forensics.

## 10. Monitoring & Alerting (Operationalisation)

| Alert | Trigger | CSCF Touchpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Secure-zone **internet egress** attempt | Deny or detect on Internet destinations | 1.4 |
| **New unexpected east-west** dependency | Baseline deviation vs ADM | 2.1 |
| **Cleartext protocol** inside zone | telnet/ftp/other plaintext signatures | 2.6 |
| **New privileged path** to SMC tier | First-seen admin flow | 1.2, 5.1 |
| **Sensor gap** | Agent inactive | 6.4 |
| **Critical CVE** on in-zone production | Vulnerability rule | 3.x |

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Mapping organizational **Mandatory** controls without architecture row | Import official v2024 matrix into Appendix A; color-code rows |
| Enforcing too aggressively during **migration** | Long simulation; staged tranches; maintenance windows |
| Mistaking **VPN Internet breakout** for "no internet" | Trace **actual** default routes and egress from **each** subnet |
| Operator **shared jump boxes** blur accountability | Pair CSW user context with **named** accounts at the bastion |
| **HSM traffic** mis-modelled | Document crypto client flows; avoid over-broad blocks |

---

## Appendix A — Mandatory vs Advisory (Official Source of Truth)

1. Obtain **CSCF v2024** from SWIFT’s authorised customer portal / your compliance lead.
2. Locate the **control applicability table** for your **architecture type**.
3. For each control in Section 7, replace the **Typical M/A** hint with your **official** M/A/N/A flag.
4. Store the signed applicability worksheet next to CSW exports in the evidence folder.

---

## Appendix B — Sample Evidence Retention Notes

- Align CSW export retention with **SOC / IR** and **records management** policy.
- Where cryptographic **integrity** of exports is required, package `SHA256SUMS.txt`
  and transfer via approved secure exchange.
