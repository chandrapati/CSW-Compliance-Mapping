# Cisco Secure Workload — COBIT 2019 Compliance Framework
## Technical Runbook | IT Governance & Assurance Teams

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** IT governance, risk, and assurance professionals aligning COBIT 2019 design factors and management objectives with measurable technical evidence; security architects implementing COBIT-aligned controls using workload telemetry and segmentation; and internal audit teams preparing for IT general control (ITGC) or integrated audits where technology evidence is required.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Which COBIT 2019 management objectives have a direct, repeatable technical expression in Cisco Secure Workload (CSW), versus objectives that remain people-and-process only?*
- *How do I demonstrate continuous monitoring of network connectivity security (DSS05.02) and logical access paths (DSS05.05) using workload-level enforcement and telemetry?*
- *What artifacts support managed performance and conformance monitoring (MEA01) and a managed system of internal control (MEA02) for the subset of objectives CSW addresses?*
- *How can change and configuration management narratives (BAI06, BAI10) be backed by software inventory deltas, ADM drift, and policy baseline comparison?*
- *What evidence exports satisfy an auditor that risk optimization inputs (EDM03) include vulnerability and reachability context for critical services?*

**What you'll need.** A current application and workload inventory, COBIT 2019 scope (which governance components and management objectives are in audit scope), and either CSW already deployed or documented scope decisions for sensor and connector coverage.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–4 if you are scoping coverage against COBIT design factors; 5–7 if you are ready to baseline dependencies and design policy; 8–10 if you are collecting audit evidence or preparing governance reporting.

## 1. Overview

COBIT 2019 is an IT governance framework published by ISACA. It organizes guidance around governance principles, design factors, and **40 management objectives** grouped into domains (EDM, APO, BAI, DSS, MEA). Unlike security-specific standards, COBIT spans enterprise goals, organizational structures, and human processes. **Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) maps to a subset of technology-dependent practices**—chiefly objectives where workload visibility, microsegmentation, vulnerability context, and forensic telemetry provide defensible evidence. Objectives concerning culture, sourcing, organizational structures, human resource practices, and pure policy documentation are **out of CSW scope** and must be satisfied by complementary controls.

This runbook focuses on the objectives the user community most often seeks to pair with CSW: security services, operations, monitoring, change/configuration signals, and risk-related technical inputs.

### 1.1 COBIT 2019 Domains and CSW Relevance (Summary)

| COBIT Domain | Focus | CSW Role |
|---|---|---|
| EDM (Evaluate, Direct and Monitor) | Governance board direction | Limited; **EDM03** gains technical inputs (risk prioritization) from CSW |
| APO (Align, Plan and Organize) | Strategy and security alignment | **APO13** partially: technical enforcement and monitoring of security architecture |
| BAI (Build, Acquire and Implement) | Delivery and change | **BAI06**, **BAI10**: technical signals for changes and configuration state |
| DSS (Deliver, Service and Support) | Operations and security services | **DSS01**, **DSS02**, **DSS05** (incl. **DSS05.02**, **DSS05.05**): strong CSW alignment |
| MEA (Monitor, Evaluate and Assess) | Performance and internal control | **MEA01**, **MEA02**: dashboards, compliance views, drift and audit exports |

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW sensors and connectors, confirm the following:

- [ ] CSW cluster (SaaS or on-premises) is provisioned and reachable from scoped workloads
- [ ] Outbound connectivity from workloads/agents to the CSW cluster (typically TCP 443)
- [ ] Linux and Windows sensor compatibility verified for all in-scope workloads
- [ ] Cloud provider accounts connected (AWS, Azure, GCP) via CSW cloud connectors where applicable
- [ ] Stakeholders identified: IT risk owner, security operations, infrastructure ownership, internal audit liaison
- [ ] Change-management approval obtained for agent installation and eventual enforcement windows
- [ ] Mapping from COBIT in-scope objectives to CSW capabilities documented (this runbook Section 7 as a starting point)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 On-Premises Workloads

**Install software sensors:**

```bash
# Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Ubuntu family)
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm    # RHEL/CentOS family
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb    # Debian/Ubuntu family

# Verify the agent service
systemctl status csw-agent || systemctl status tetration-agent
```

**Key sensor configuration (COBIT-aligned):**

- Enforcement mode: **Monitoring Only** initially (no blocking until baselined)
- Collection: Enable process, network flow, and software inventory where supported; enable vulnerability exposure features for risk workflows (**EDM03**, **APO13**)
- Tags: Apply governance and ownership metadata from day one, for example `governance:cobit`, `domain:DSS`, `criticality:high`, `owner:it-ops`

### 3.2 Cloud Workloads (AWS / Azure / GCP)

**Option A — Software sensor on cloud VMs:** Same installation pattern as on-premises.

**Option B — CSW cloud connectors (agentless inventory/flow context):**

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Add AWS / Azure / GCP connector
  → Attach least-privilege IAM role (AWS) or service principal (Azure)
  → Enable flow log or cloud network telemetry ingestion per vendor guidance
```

### 3.3 Sensor Validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → Confirm agents are Active and versions are standardized
  → Verify telemetry (flows/process events) visible for each scope pilot
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope and Inventory Design (Days 6–10)

### 4.1 Governance-Aligned Scope Hierarchy

Design scopes to mirror how the enterprise manages services and risk, not only network topology:

```
Root Scope
└── Enterprise-IT
    ├── Production-Critical
    │   ├── Tier-1-Apps
    │   ├── Data-Platforms
    │   └── Identity-Dependencies
    ├── Corporate-Services
    ├── Development-Test
    └── Third-Party-Integration
```

Align labels with COBIT accountability (roles are organizational; labels are technical anchors for evidence):

| Label Key | Example Values | COBIT Tie-In |
|---|---|---|
| `cobit_domain` | DSS, BAI, MEA | Reporting filters for objective owners |
| `service_tier` | tier0, tier1, tier2 | Prioritization for **EDM03** / **APO13** |
| `owner_team` | app-name + ops team | Traceability for **DSS01** operations narratives |
| `data_class` | regulated, internal, public | Scope for logical access policy (**DSS05.05**) |

### 4.2 Inventory Filters for Critical Platforms

```
Filter: Identity-and-Directory
  - Process: samba, krb5kdc, sssd, ntp, named
  - Ports: 389, 636, 88, 464

Filter: Data-Tier
  - Process: mysqld, postgres, oracle, sqlservr, mongod, redis-server
  - Ports: 3306, 5432, 1521, 1433, 27017, 6379

Filter: Admin-Tooling
  - Process: sshd, winrm, MMC-related patterns (validate in your environment)
  - Use for **DSS05.05** logical path reviews (not identity MFA)
```

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Visibility, Baseline, and ADM (Days 11–21)

### 5.1 Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)

ADM establishes the observed communication graph—foundational for **DSS05.02** (network and connectivity security) and for validating that **managed operations** (**DSS01**) reflect reality.

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → New Workspace
  → Name: "COBIT-DSS-Baseline-ADM"
  → Scope: Production-Critical (expand iteratively)
  → Time window: 2–4 weeks (cover month-end and change windows)
  → Start ADM
```

**ADM settings:**

- Enable **process context** on connections
- Enable **user context** where the sensor supports it (**DSS05.05** logical access path analysis)
- Retain sufficient history for **MEA01** trend reporting (minimum 30 days; align to internal record retention)

### 5.2 Baseline Questions Mapped to COBIT Objectives

| Question during ADM review | Primary COBIT objective |
|---|---|
| Which tier-1 workloads accept inbound connections from non-production? | **DSS05.02**, **APO13** |
| Are administrative paths constrained to jump hosts or shared tooling? | **DSS05.05** |
| What external SaaS or partner networks do critical apps rely on? | **DSS01**, **DSS05** |
| Did new software versions appear without a matching change ticket? | **BAI06** |
| Did listener ports or processes change against an approved baseline? | **BAI10** |

### 5.3 Change and Configuration Signals (**BAI06**, **BAI10**)

Use CSW to **detect** technical drift; pair with ITSM for **authorize**:

```bash
# Example: export inventory snapshot via CSW API/UI on a schedule (pseudo-workflow)
# 1. CSW UI → Investigate → Inventory → Export CSV (weekly)
# 2. Diff against prior week for: new packages, new listening ports, new long-lived processes
# 3. Attach diff to change record or exception register
```

Operationalize: schedule **weekly inventory exports** and **90-day ADM re-baselines** for tier-1 scopes.

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design and Enforcement (Days 22–35)

### 6.1 COBIT-Oriented Policy Workspace

Translate DSS connectivity and access objectives into CSW segmentation policy:

**Illustrative absolute policies (tune to your ADM):**

```
DENY: Development-Test → Production-Critical (all ports)
DENY: Production-Critical → Internet (default; allow explicit egress exceptions only)
DENY: Any-NonJumpHost → Production-Critical (ports 22, 3389, WinRM ranges)
```

**Illustrative allowlist policies:**

```
ALLOW: Tier-1-Apps → Data-Platforms (application-specific ports from ADM)
ALLOW: Tier-1-Apps → Identity-Dependencies (LDAPS 636 / Kerberos as validated)
ALLOW: Monitored-Jump-Host → Production-Critical (admin ports, source-locked)
ALLOW: Production-Critical → Corporate-Patch-Mirror (update paths only)
ALLOW: Scoped-Workloads → CSW-Cluster (443 to telemetry endpoints)
```

**Catch-all instrumentation:**

```
LOG: unmatched inbound to Production-Critical
LOG: unmatched outbound from Production-Critical
ALERT: first-seen external destination from Tier-1-Apps
```

### 6.2 Policy Workspace Setup

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → New Workspace
  → Name: "COBIT-DSS05-Production"
  → Scope: Production-Critical
  → Import ADM-recommended rules → refine with owners
  → Mode: Simulation → Enforcement (staged)
```

### 6.3 Enforcement Progression

| Stage | Mode | Duration | COBIT intent |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Simulation | 2+ weeks | **MEA01**—observe deviation before blocking |
| 2 | Selective enforcement | 1–2 weeks | **DSS05.02**—reduce connectivity risk incrementally |
| 3 | Full enforcement (approved ruleset) | Ongoing | **APO13** / **DSS05**—sustained technical control |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Control-by-Control Mapping

The table below maps **selected COBIT 2019 management objectives and focus areas** to CSW capabilities and **representative evidence**. COBIT component practices (activity-level detail) should be mapped in your internal control library; CSW addresses the **technology** slice only.

| COBIT objective / focus area | CSW capability | Evidence produced |
|---|---|---|
| **APO13** Managed Security | Microsegmentation workspaces; always-on flow/process telemetry; vulnerability exposure views | Policy workspace exports; simulation vs enforcement reports; alerting history; risk-prioritized exposure reports |
| **DSS01** Managed Operations | Continuous flow and process monitoring; inventory; operational dashboards | Flow search exports; inventory CSV; agent health views; top-talkers and dependency maps |
| **DSS02** Managed Service Requests and Incidents | Forensic flow and process search; parent/child process context | Incident-timeline exports; filtered flow captures; process execution chains for IoC windows |
| **DSS05** Managed Security Services | Segmentation enforcement; network visibility; optional integration points for detection workflows | Block/allow decision logs; policy hit counts; segmentation coverage reports |
| **DSS05.02** Network and Connectivity Security | Microsegmentation; explicit allow/deny; east-west visibility | ADM graph snapshots; enforced policy JSON/YAML exports; violation alerts |
| **DSS05.05** Physical and Logical Access | Logical path restriction (network layer); visibility into admin tooling paths *Note: identity, MFA, and physical access remain out of scope* | Rules restricting admin ports to jump hosts; flows showing actual paths used |
| **MEA01** Managed Performance and Conformance Monitoring | Compliance dashboards; policy conformance; trend reporting | Scheduled dashboard PDF/exports; conformance % over time; SLA-style reporting packs |
| **MEA02** Managed System of Internal Control | Drift detection (inventory vs baseline); policy versioning; audit exports | Weekly diffs; policy baseline checksum/history; signed export bundle for auditors |
| **BAI06** Managed IT Changes | New packages, listeners, and dependencies surfaced post-change | Inventory delta reports; ADM diff after change window; correlation to ITSM IDs (manual link) |
| **BAI10** Managed Configuration | Baselined listeners/process sets; scope hygiene | Baseline exports; non-compliant workload list; scope membership snapshots |
| **EDM03** Ensured Risk Optimization | CVE awareness with reachability/exposure context; prioritization for patching | Vulnerability reports filtered by tier; reachability analysis outputs; executive risk summaries |

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Vulnerability, Reachability, and Risk Inputs (**EDM03**, **APO13**)

### 8.1 Vulnerability and Exposure Reporting

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: Production-Critical
  → Filters: business tier, CVSS, EPSS (where available), known exploit context
  → Export for risk committee / audit working papers
```

### 8.2 Prioritization Pattern

1. **Internet- or partner-exposed** workloads with critical CVEs (patch or segment first)  
2. **Lateral** reachable high-value workloads from compromised entry points  
3. **Deep** internal workloads with CVEs but no observed risky paths (document compensating segmentation)

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Monitoring, Drift, and Audit Evidence (**MEA01**, **MEA02**)

### 9.1 Monitoring Patterns

| Monitor | Trigger | COBIT relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Policy violation rate spike | Sudden blocks or denies | **DSS01**, **DSS05** |
| New external destination | First-seen egress | **DSS05.02**, **APO13** |
| Inventory delta | New high-risk packages | **BAI06**, **BAI10** |
| Agent offline | Loss of visibility | **MEA01**, **DSS01** |
| Scope drift | Untagged assets in tier-1 subnets | **MEA02** |

### 9.2 Forensic Use (**DSS02**)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → Time range: incident window
  → Source/Destination: affected workload or subnet
  → Export: CSV/JSON with process attributes

CSW UI → Investigate → Process Search
  → Filter: workload + time + suspicious parent chain
  → Export for IR retention index
```

Align retention with enterprise records management; CSW exports are **copies** for legal/audit holds.

---

## 10. Boundaries — What CSW Does **Not** Cover

Document these explicitly in control narratives to avoid over-claiming COBIT satisfaction:

- **Governance culture, board oversight, and management accountability** (EDM broadly): CSW is not a governance operating model.
- **Human resources, competencies, and behavior** (numerous APO/BAI practices): out of scope.
- **Third-party contractual and procurement controls**: CSW does not manage vendor SLAs or contract clauses.
- **Physical security**: no facility controls; only **logical** network path restrictions.
- **Identity lifecycle, credentials, MFA, and authorization decisions** (IdP/PAM): CSW does not replace IAM; it **restricts network paths** and **observes** process behavior.
- **Full SOX/financial controls or GRC workflow**: integrate CSW exports into your GRC tool; CSW is not a controls library.
- **All 40 COBIT objectives**: this runbook targets **technology-evidence-friendly** objectives; others require policy, process, and other tools.

---

## 11. Audit Preparation and Evidence Export

### 11.1 Typical Evidence Package (Quarterly or Audit Window)

| Evidence item | CSW source | Suggested frequency | Mapped objectives |
|---|---|---|---|
| Segmentation policy workspace export | Defend → Segmentation | Each release + quarterly | **DSS05.02**, **APO13** |
| Simulation vs enforcement acknowledgement | Policy lifecycle records | Per cutover | **MEA02** |
| ADM baseline snapshot | Investigate → ADM | 90 days | **DSS01**, **BAI10** |
| Inventory baseline + delta | Investigate → Inventory | Weekly/monthly | **BAI06**, **BAI10** |
| Vulnerability + reachability summary | Investigate → Vulnerability | Monthly | **EDM03** |
| Alert and violation extracts | Alerts / SIEM forward | Incident + sample periods | **DSS02**, **MEA01** |
| Agent coverage report | Manage → Agents | Monthly | **MEA01** |

### 11.2 Control Testing Tips

- **Design effectiveness**: Show that tier-1 scopes are fully sensor-covered and enforcement mode matches policy intent.  
- **Operating effectiveness**: Sample time windows; pull flows proving denied paths remain denied; verify drift tickets exist for inventory anomalies.  
- **Gap handling**: If a COBIT practice requires HR training or vendor attestations, keep CSW evidence **adjacent** (same control ID) but **not substitutive**.

### 11.3 Bash-Oriented Automation Hooks (Illustrative)

Integrate with your CI or SOC tooling; adjust endpoints to your CSW deployment:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Illustrative: archive weekly inventory export from a secured jump host
DATE=$(date +%F)
EXPORT_DIR="/secure/evidence/csw/${DATE}"
mkdir -p "${EXPORT_DIR}"
# Replace with your approved CSW API/export mechanism:
# curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CSW_API_TOKEN}" \
#   "https://<csw-cluster>/api/v1/inventory/export?scope=tier1" \
#   -o "${EXPORT_DIR}/inventory-tier1.csv"
echo "Placeholder: perform UI or API export into ${EXPORT_DIR}"
sha256sum "${EXPORT_DIR}"/* > "${EXPORT_DIR}/MANIFEST.sha256" || true
```

> **Note:** Use your organization’s approved API tokens, IP allow lists, and secrets management—never embed live tokens in scripts committed to repositories.

---

## 12. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Asserting CSW satisfies an entire COBIT objective | Decompose to practices; attach CSW evidence only to technology-addressable practices |
| Mapping **DSS05.05** to IAM or MFA | Keep narrative precise: CSW enforces **logical network paths** and observes admin tooling; IdP/PAM owns identity |
| Skipping simulation before enforcement | Run segmentation in simulation long enough to capture batch and admin windows (**MEA01**) |
| ADM window too short for **BAI06** / **BAI10** | Use minimum 2–4 weeks; include known change freezes and releases |
| Tier-1 assets missing agents | Treat coverage gaps as **MEA02** control deficiencies until remediated |
| Policy drift undocumented | Version policy exports; store checksums or Git-backed artifacts alongside change tickets |

---

## Appendix A — COBIT and ISO/NIST Cross-Walk (Orientation)

Many enterprises map COBIT to ISO/IEC 27001 or NIST SP 800-53. CSW technical evidence generated for connectivity security and monitoring often **feeds** those mappings even when the audit framework is COBIT-first. Maintain a single **evidence repository** keyed by control ID to avoid duplicate work.
