## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** UK NIS Operators of Essential Services and GovAssure
(Cabinet Office Government Security Group) teams, plus the Cisco SEs and
compliance engineers preparing CAF evidence for a Competent Authority or a
GovAssure assessor.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *A3 — which workloads are inside the essential function, and which were
  deliberately left out?*
- *B5 — what actually enforces segmentation between those workloads, and
  can I show it still held on a given day?*
- *B1 — is the policy a document, or is it versioned and enforced?*
- *C1 — can I produce flow evidence with process context, not a sample of
  firewall logs?*
- *B2 and B6 — what must I point to outside CSW?*

**Where to start.** The applicability table below, then Phase 1 if the
essential-function boundary is not yet a CSW scope. The principle-by-principle
crosswalk is [caf-mapping.md](./caf-mapping.md).

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why a CAF assessor cares |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary for an essential function | The systems the assessment actually covers |
| **Label** | Tag assigning a workload to that boundary | Shows what was included and what was carved out |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | The live flow diagram behind B5 |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one essential function | Where B1 policies are authored and versioned |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation is evidence before traffic is blocked |
| **Denied Connections** | Flows blocked by policy | Proof that B5 enforcement operates |

## Universal evidence workflow

Run these phases on the CAF essential-function boundary. The CAF-specific
scope tree, labels, and artefact names are in the phases below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload is visible | Agents or connectors; CAF labels; essential-function scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Observed flows, not a diagram from memory | ADM for at least two business cycles | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Workspace; Simulation; exception register | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Evidence between assessments | Enforce; monthly snapshot; quarterly pack | Ongoing |

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Identity and MFA (B2), staff training (B6), encryption and key management,
backups and restore, perimeter and DDoS controls, and the OT device tier
still need their own programmes. CSW covers the workload-resident slice:
inventory, segmentation, flows, process context, vulnerability reachability,
and change between snapshots.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

Applicability uses the repository standard. **Direct evidence** means CSW
is a leading source for the technical indicators. It does not mean the
principle is achieved. **Supporting evidence** means CSW supplements a
control owned elsewhere. **Out of scope** means point the assessor somewhere
else.

| Principle | Applicability | What to show |
|---|---|---|
| A1 Governance | Supporting evidence | Posture summary for the board pack. Not roles, resourcing, or risk appetite. |
| A2 Risk management | Direct evidence | Blast-radius, enforcement coverage, and reachability trend between snapshots. |
| A3 Asset management | Direct evidence | Sensor census, package inventory, and a dated scope snapshot. |
| A4 Supply chain | Supporting evidence | Observed vendor egress versus the supplier register. |
| B1 Policies and processes | Direct evidence | Versioned workspace policy and simulation-before-enforce record. |
| B2 Identity and access | Out of scope | IdP and PAM. ISE can feed identity into policy; it does not replace them. |
| B3 Data security | Supporting evidence | East-west path control and plaintext-protocol deny. Not encryption or DLP. |
| B4 System security | Direct evidence | Per-workload CVE and package inventory, plus config drift. |
| B5 Resilient networks | Direct evidence | In-kernel microsegmentation, denied connections, IT side of an IT/OT boundary. |
| B6 Staff awareness | Out of scope | Training programme. |
| C1 Security monitoring | Direct evidence | Continuous flow telemetry with process context and the policy decision. |
| C2 Proactive discovery | Direct evidence | Forensic events and vulnerability reachability. Pair with threat intelligence and EDR. |
| D1 Response and recovery | Supporting evidence | Containment and a forensic timeline. Not backup, RTO, or restore. |
| D2 Improvements | Supporting evidence | Snapshot delta across quarters for the lessons-learned review. |

Seven principles take a direct evidence contribution (A2, A3, B1, B4, B5,
C1, C2). Five are supporting (A1, A4, B3, D1, D2). Two are out of scope
(B2, B6).

## 0. Prerequisites

- CSW cluster deployed and reachable; agents installed on all workloads in
  scope for the essential service.
- API key with capabilities: `sensor_management`, `app_policy_management`,
  `flow_inventory_query`, `software_inventory`, `user_data_upload`.
- Operations toolkit cloned
  ([CSW_POV_Template](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Operations-Toolkit)
  or equivalent) — specifically `cluster_snapshot.py`,
  `generate_vuln_report.py`, `generate_forensics_report.py`,
  `generate_executive_report.py`.
- Scope hierarchy modelled with CAF scope in mind (see Phase 1 below).

---

## 1. Phase 1 — Scope definition

CAF applies to **essential functions** and the systems supporting them. The
first engineering job is to translate "essential functions" into a CSW scope
hierarchy an auditor can read.

### Recommended CSW scope pattern

```
root-scope
├── CAF:Essential-Function:<name>        ← one per essential function
│   ├── Tier:Web
│   ├── Tier:App
│   ├── Tier:Data
│   └── Tier:Support                      ← identity, patching, backup
├── CAF:Supporting:<name>                 ← systems supporting an EF but not the EF itself
└── CAF:Out-of-Scope                      ← explicitly carved out
```

Workloads inside `CAF:Essential-Function:*` are "in scope" for the CAF
assessment. The explicit `CAF:Out-of-Scope` scope exists so an assessor
can see what was deliberately excluded and why.

### Labels / tags to apply (per workload)

| Label | Example values | CAF principle this feeds |
|---|---|---|
| `caf_essential_function` | `electricity_distribution`, `patient_record_system` | A3, B5 |
| `caf_tier` | `web`, `app`, `data`, `support`, `ot_adjacent` | B5, B1 |
| `caf_data_classification` | `ePHI`, `PII`, `operational`, `public` | A3, B3 |
| `caf_criticality` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` | A2 |
| `caf_owner_team` | `payments_eng`, `clinical_apps` | A1, A3 |
| `caf_regulator` | `ofgem`, `ofcom`, `dwi`, `caa`, `dft`, `dhsc`, `govassure` | — |

Push these as annotations via `user_data_upload` from your CMDB.

### Deliverable from Phase 1

- `scope-model.md` — explains the scope tree and the labels, signed off by
  the CAF scoping SME.
- `scope-workloads.json` — snapshot of which workload lives in which CAF
  scope (produced via `cluster_snapshot.py`).

---

## 2. Phase 2 — Policy authoring per CAF principle

Policies live inside CSW workspaces. One workspace per essential function
is the recommended pattern.

### Policy design per principle

- **B5 (segmentation):** Default-deny between CAF essential-function scopes;
  explicit allows only for documented data flows; cross-tier flows
  restricted to the specific ports/processes ADM identified. For IT/OT
  separation, add an explicit `CAF:Essential-Function:*` → `CAF:OT-Zone:*`
  deny with narrow exceptions.
- **B1 (policies & processes):** Every policy carries a human-readable
  description; version tagged with change ticket; owner labelled.
- **B4 (system security):** Policies that deny known-vulnerable-service
  ports (telnet, old SMB, plaintext SNMP) across all CAF scopes.
- **B3 (data security — in transit):** FIPS-aligned deny of plaintext
  protocols for workloads tagged `caf_data_classification=PII` or stricter
  (see [FIPS 140 runbook](../FIPS-140/) for pattern).

### ADM → simulate → enforce workflow

1. Run ADM on each `CAF:Essential-Function:*` workspace to get a baseline
   policy proposal.
2. Review in CSW UI; adjust against the documented authorised data flows
   for the essential function.
3. **Simulate** for at least two full business cycles (typically 2 weeks)
   before enforcement. Simulation reports become evidence for A2
   ("continuous, not annual").
4. Enforce in staged rings: Tier:Support → Tier:Web → Tier:App → Tier:Data.
5. Keep ADM version history as change log — this is B1 evidence.

### Deliverable from Phase 2

- `policies-authored.json` (via `download_policies.py`) — the current policy
  set per workspace.
- `simulation-report-<yyyy-mm-dd>.html` per essential function — pre-enforcement
  evidence of what would be allowed vs rejected.
- `policy-change-log-<yyyy-mm-dd>.md` — ADM versions and the human-approved
  changes between them.

## 3. Phase 3 — Evidence collection per CAF Objective

Automate the following so evidence is produced on a cadence, not scrambled
for the audit.

### Monthly (per cluster)

```bash
python3 cluster_snapshot.py            # A3, A2, B4 (point-in-time inventory + posture)
python3 generate_vuln_report.py        # B4, A2 (CVE inventory with CVM intel)
python3 generate_forensics_report.py   # C2 (MITRE technique coverage)
python3 download_flows.py --hours 720  # C1 (30-day flow archive)
python3 generate_executive_report.py \
  --snapshot-latest \
  --prepared-for "<Essential Function Owner>" \
  --prepared-by "SecOps"               # A1, A2 governance telemetry
```

### Weekly (per cluster)

```bash
python3 cluster_delta.py \
  --from snapshots/snapshot-<prev-week>.json \
  --to   snapshots/snapshot-<this-week>.json   # D2 improvement evidence
```

### Per enforcement change

```bash
python3 download_policies.py           # B1 change log
```

### Mapping evidence artefacts to CAF Objectives

| CSW artefact | CAF Objectives served |
|---|---|
| `snapshot-*.json` | A2, A3, A4 (partial), B4 |
| `vulnerabilities-*.csv` | A2, B4 |
| `policies-all.json` + ADM version history | B1, B5 |
| `conversations-*.json` / `flows-*.csv` | C1, B5 (verification), D1 (IR timeline) |
| `forensics-posture-*.html` | C2 |
| `simulation-report-*.html` | A2, B1 |
| `executive-summary-*.html` / `.md` | A1, A2 |
| `cluster-delta-*.md` | D2 |

---

## 4. Phase 4 — Quarterly CAF evidence pack

A GovAssure or OES Competent Authority submission typically wants an
evidence pack covering each CAF principle. Pre-stage the files monthly;
assemble the pack quarterly.

### Pack structure

```
caf-evidence-pack-<yyyy-qq>/
├── 00_overview.md                      ← executive summary + scope attestation
├── A1_Governance/
├── A2_Risk_Management/
├── A3_Asset_Management/
├── A4_Supply_Chain/
├── B1_Policies_Processes/
├── B2_Identity_Access/                 ← pointer to IdP evidence (no CSW output)
├── B3_Data_Security/

## 5. Common assessor questions and the CSW answer

| Question | CSW evidence |
|---|---|
| *"Prove the control still held last Tuesday, not just today."* | Monthly `snapshot-*.json` and flow archive — point-in-time attestation. |
| *"How do you know you'd see an attacker moving laterally?"* | Flow telemetry + rejected-flows report + MITRE forensics coverage. |
| *"How do you measure improvement since the last assessment?"* | `cluster_delta.py` output + `executive-summary` trend. |
| *"What enforces the segmentation — is it just a firewall rule you hope stays?"* | Policies are enforced in-kernel on every host (nftables / WFP); CSW continuously verifies. |
| *"How do you handle supplier access?"* | Scope-tagged egress flows; vendor-package inventory; pair with TPRM. |
| *"What about identity?"* | Explicit: CSW is not an IAM tool. Point to IdP + PAM evidence. |

---

## 6. SE / SA conversation starters

Lift from the repo's
[SE compliance role-play](../docs/se-compliance-cyber-insurance-roleplay.md)
but tailored to a UK assessor conversation:

1. *"Which of your essential functions is being assessed first — and how
    many workloads sit inside its boundary?"* → scopes problem to real
    numbers.
2. *"Who is your Competent Authority for this programme (Ofgem? DWI? GSG?)
    and what have they flagged in prior assessments?"* → anchors conversation
    in regulator language.
3. *"Can you show me the current scope-isolation attestation between IT
    and OT today?"* → opens IEC 62443 / Purdue conversation; CSW is the
    IT side.
4. *"When you need to tell your Competent Authority that control X still
    held last Tuesday, where does that evidence come from?"* → surfaces
    continuous-vs-annual pain, where CSW shines.

---

## 7. Known limitations and pairings

- **B2 (Identity):** CSW cannot satisfy. Pair with IdP + PAM. Use
  [ISE integration](https://github.com/chandrapati/csw-ise-integration) for
  identity-aware segmentation (identity assertion from ISE).
- **B6 (Training):** Out of scope.
- **D1 (Backup/DR):** CSW contains blast radius; it does not restore
  services. Pair with backup/DR platform.
- **OT device tier:** CSW does not run on PLCs/RTUs/IEDs. Pair with
  Cyber Vision / Claroty / Nozomi / Dragos.
- **Perimeter / DDoS:** CSW is east-west only. Pair with Secure Firewall
  and DDoS service.
