# Cisco Secure Workload — CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model
## Technical Runbook | Federal & Enterprise Accounts

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0 (2023)

---

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Federal civilian agencies executing on
EO 14028 / OMB M-22-09, federal contractors with parallel obligations,
enterprises that have adopted CISA's maturity model voluntarily.

**Questions this runbook helps you answer:**

- *Across the 5 ZTMM pillars (Identity, Devices, Networks,
  Applications & Workloads, Data), where am I today on the
  Traditional → Initial → Advanced → Optimal scale, and where is the
  evidence?*
- *What's the smallest set of changes that moves my Networks pillar
  and my Applications & Workloads pillar from Initial to Advanced?*
- *For OMB M-22-09 progress reporting, what artifacts can I produce
  on a quarterly basis without rerunning manual assessments?*
- *Reaching "Optimal" on a pillar implies continuous validation. What
  does that look like as a daily operational signal, not an annual
  audit one?*
- *Where do I depend on other Cisco portfolio products (Identity,
  Endpoint, Cloud, Data) to reach Optimal across all five pillars?*

**What you'll need.** Your current ZTMM self-assessment (or a
willingness to do one), a prioritized list of pillars by business
risk, and visibility into your existing IdP, EDR, and CSPM tooling.

**Where to start.** Sections 2–4 for pillar-by-pillar capability
mapping; section 5 for the coverage summary across all pillars;
section 6 for a phased deployment plan; section 8 if your team uses a
scorecard format.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Networks + Applications/Workloads pillar progression with measurable maturity
- Observable enforce mode vs. monitor-only baseline
- Policy enforcement at workload as ZT PEP placement

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

## 1. Overview

The CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM) v2.0 defines maturity across **5 pillars**: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications & Workloads, and Data. CSW is the primary Cisco platform addressing the **Networks** pillar and makes significant contributions to **Applications & Workloads** and **Data** pillars. Each pillar has 4 maturity stages: Traditional → Initial → Advanced → Optimal.

---

## 2. CSW Maturity Mapping — Networks Pillar (Primary)

The Networks pillar focuses on macro/micro-segmentation, encryption, and network traffic management.

| Maturity Stage | Networks Pillar Requirement | CSW Capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Traditional** | Coarse perimeter-based segmentation | CSW ADM reveals actual traffic — baseline for improvement |
| **Initial** | Basic internal segmentation; some visibility | CSW ADM deployed; monitoring mode; scopes defined |
| **Advanced** | Micro-segmentation enforced; encrypted traffic | CSW enforcement active; allowlist policies; encryption detection |
| **Optimal** | Dynamic policy; continuous validation; full automation | CSW ADM continuous re-run; API-driven policy updates; ML anomaly detection |

### Achieving Advanced Maturity (Networks)

```
Phase 1 — Initial (Weeks 1-4):
  ✓ Deploy CSW sensors across all workloads
  ✓ Run ADM — document all traffic flows
  ✓ Define scope hierarchy (environment, sensitivity, function)
  ✓ Enable flow telemetry and alerting

Phase 2 — Advanced (Weeks 5-12):
  ✓ Build allowlist policies from ADM baseline
  ✓ Enable enforcement mode on sensitive scopes
  ✓ Detect and block unencrypted flows (HTTP, Telnet, FTP)
  ✓ Isolate workloads into least-privilege network segments
  ✓ Configure anomaly detection on production scopes

Phase 3 — Optimal (Ongoing):
  ✓ Continuous ADM re-runs (90-day cycles)
  ✓ API integration with SOAR for automated policy response
  ✓ ML-based behavioral baseline deviation detection
  ✓ Dynamic policy adjustment based on workload risk score
```

## 3. CSW Maturity Mapping — Applications & Workloads Pillar

| Maturity Stage | Requirement | CSW capability that may support evidence toward the stage |
|---|---|---|
| **Traditional** | No workload-level visibility | ADM provides first-ever workload communication map |
| **Initial** | Basic application inventory; some access controls | CSW inventory + scope-based access policies |
| **Advanced** | Workload identity-based access; continuous monitoring | Process-level identity; policy enforcement; anomaly detection |
| **Optimal** | Automated workload security; continuous validation | API-driven policy; vulnerability-triggered policy updates |

**Key CSW Contributions:**
- **Workload Identity:** CSW uses process hash, OS fingerprint, and network identity — not just IP
- **Least Privilege Workload Access:** Each workload allowed only its documented communication paths
- **Continuous Validation:** ADM re-runs validate workloads haven't expanded their access footprint
- **Vulnerability-Aware Policy:** Critical CVEs on a workload can trigger automatic policy tightening

---

## 4. CSW Maturity Mapping — Data Pillar (Supporting)

| Maturity Stage | Requirement | CSW Capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Traditional** | No data flow visibility | ADM reveals observed data movement paths within CSW coverage |
| **Initial** | Data categorized; basic access controls | Scope-based isolation for sensitive data workloads |
| **Advanced** | Data access logged; encryption enforced | Full flow telemetry; encryption compliance enforcement |
| **Optimal** | Automated data protection response | Alert-triggered policy updates on data access violations |

---

## 5. CISA ZTMM Pillar Coverage Summary

| Pillar | CSW Role | Example maturity evidence CSW may support |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | Supporting (enforces identity-aware workload access paths where integrated) | Initial → Advanced evidence when paired with IAM / IdP controls |
| Devices | Supporting (process + OS-level workload fingerprinting) | Initial → Advanced evidence for covered workloads |
| Networks | **Primary** for workload micro-segmentation, plaintext-flow detection / blocking, monitoring | Advanced evidence; Optimal remains an organizational target |
| Applications & Workloads | **Primary** for workload identity, policy, vulnerability context | Advanced evidence; Optimal remains an organizational target |
| Data | Supporting (data flow visibility, plaintext-flow detection / blocking) | Initial → Advanced evidence when paired with data governance controls |
